The High Court has to be satisfied on the materials on record that the Authority has not acted in an arbitrary or erratic manner. 10. So far the facts of the present case are concerned, it is an admitted position that in the pro forma attached to the application for registration, the appellant said that the M.P. Housing Board vs Anil Kumar Khiwani on 14 March, 2005 price mentioned by them was a probable and estimated cost, the definite price shall be intimated at the time of the allotment. Thereafter, the appellant had been informing the respondents and others who had got themselves registered, from time to time regarding the escalation in the cost of the flat. One of the reasons for the rise of the price for the LIG flat from Rs.60,000 to Rs.1,16,000 appears to be the increase in the area of the flat itself from 500 sq. ft. to 714.94 sq. ft. From 1982 to 1984, possession of the flats could not be delivered because of the dispute pending in the Court which also contributed to the increase in the cost of the flat. Admittedly, the respondents came in possession of the flats in the year 1984",
