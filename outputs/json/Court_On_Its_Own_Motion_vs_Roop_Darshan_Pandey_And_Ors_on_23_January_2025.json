The allegations are also similar, i.e., use of Hero MotoCorp Limited seal for attesting the true copy of documents which were belonging to Hero Honda Motors Limited, the predecessor in the interest company. The use of the said seal is stated to be only due to a name change which took place and all the allegations in the criminal complaint being filed are on the basis of the said true copy attestation. iii. Mr. Dayan Krishnan, ld. Counsel also points out that even recently another notice has been issued by Mr. Pandey on 15 th December, 2024 to the entire board of directors of HML, making allegations of forgery of the Board Resolution. In this manner, Mr. Pandey continues to harass the company as also all its officials. iv. The ld. Senior Counsel has also brought to the notice of the Court, the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 11th September, 2024, which again notes all the proceedings which are pending and the manner in which multiple applications, petitions, criminal complaints are being filed against the company and its officials. The observations in the said order are referred to. v. It is further submitted that the entire attempt of Mr. Pandey is to merely extort a substantial sum of money. Though, the company is willing to pay the amount as per the Arbitral award along with the interest, he is unwilling to take the same and is subjecting the company and its officials to continuous harassment in this manner. 16. Mr. Deepak Dahiya submits that he has not issued the notice and that he is not a part of CPS Legal. It is submitted that the notice was signed by Mr. Mohit Yadav, though, his name does not appear in the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submitted that from the signature, it can be deciphered that Mr. Yadav has signed the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submits that the unconditional apologies have been submitted both on behalf of himself and Mr. Mohit Yadav and the legal notice which was given has also been withdrawn. 17.
