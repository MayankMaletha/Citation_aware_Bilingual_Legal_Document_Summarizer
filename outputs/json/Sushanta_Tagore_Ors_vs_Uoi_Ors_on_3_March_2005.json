What is being objected to by them is constructions of huge Sushanta Tagore & Ors vs Uoi&Ors on 3 March, 2005 residential and commercial complexes which even according to the High Court would not only change the topography but also would change the place almost beyond the recognition of the poet. It may be true that the development of a town is the job of the town planning authority but the same should conform to the requirements of law. Development must be sustainable in nature. A land use plan should be prepared not only having regard to the provisions contained in the 1979 Act and the rules and regulations framed thereunder but also the provisions of other statues enacted therefor and in particular those for protection and preservation of ecology and environment. As Visva Bharati has the unique distinction of being not only a University of national importance but also a unitary one, the SSDA should be well-advised to keep in mind the provisions of the Act, the object and purpose for which it has been enacted as also the report of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. It is sui generis. It is idle to compare Shantiniketan with any other university. Truism is that Shantiniketan has unique features. Its environmental ambiance, thus, must be maintained. There is no other university which having regard to the purport and object of the Act, as would appear from the objects and reasons thereof, can be compared with Visva Bharati. Our attention has not been drawn to any other statute establishing any university which has such unique features as Visva Bharati. Only because some advantages would ensue to the people in general by reason of the proposed development, the same would not mean that the ecology of the place would be sacrificed. Only because some encroachments have been made and unauthorized buildings have been constructed, the same by itself cannot be a good ground for allowing other constructional activities to come up which would be in violation of the provisions of the Act. Illegal encroachments, if any, may be removed in accordance with law. It is trite law that thee is no equality in illegality. The Parliamentary Debates, some of which we have noticed hereinbefore, clearly go to show that the Act was enacted with particular objectives in view. Such statutory objects could not have been given a go by. It is not suggested that the Santiniketan should remain as it was in 1921 but it cannot be permitted to become full of concrete jungles and industrial hub. For carrying out further constructional activities, it may not be necessary for a builder to apply to the University for seeking its permission but the local-self government which is responsible therefor must take into consideration the salutary principles laid down in the pollution control laws as well as the Act. The land use and future planning of Santiniketan must be done in such a manner so that the changes be brought about which would not be beyond the recognition of the poet as also the provisions of the Act. SSDA in that sense must distinguish itself from the other development authorities. It has an extra-burden to shoulder. It cannot shut its eyes to the provisions of the Act and the object and purport it seeks to achieve. It cannot ignore the environmental impact assessment made by the Board. It is one thing to say that the SSDA may permit small constructions to be made by the owners of the land or additions or allow alterations to the existing building for residential purposes but it is another thing to say that it would not consider the effect of the changes which may be brought about by turning Santiniketan into a commercial and industrial hub.

The learned counsel would contend that by reason of such constructional activities neither the academic programme of the University as contemplated under Section 5B of the Act nor the academic territory of the University has contemplated under Section 7 thereof are affected. The University itself having not claimed any ownership in respect of the land beyond what had been acquired for its purpose, and, thus, the writ petition filed by the Appellant herein had rightly been dismissed.

      "raw": "It may be true that the Appellants herein have their own houses within 3000 acres of land but they have been residing there for a long time. What is being objected to by them is constructions of huge Sushanta Tagore & Ors vs Uoi&Ors on 3 March, 2005 residential and commercial complexes which even according to the High Court would not only change the topography but also would change the place almost beyond the recognition of the poet. It may be true that the development of a town is the job of the town planning authority but the same should conform to the requirements of law. Development must be sustainable in nature. A land use plan should be prepared not only having regard to the provisions contained in the 1979 Act and the rules and regulations framed thereunder but also the provisions of other statues enacted therefor and in particular those for protection and preservation of ecology and environment. As Visva Bharati has the unique distinction of being not only a University of national importance but also a unitary one, the SSDA should be well-advised to keep in mind the provisions of the Act, the object and purpose for which it has been enacted as also the report of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. It is sui generis. It is idle to compare Shantiniketan with any other university. Truism is that Shantiniketan has unique features. Its environmental ambiance, thus, must be maintained. There is no other university which having regard to the purport and object of the Act, as would appear from the objects and reasons thereof, can be compared with Visva Bharati. Our attention has not been drawn to any other statute establishing any university which has such unique features as Visva Bharati. Only because some advantages would ensue to the people in general by reason of the proposed development, the same would not mean that the ecology of the place would be sacrificed. Only because some encroachments have been made and unauthorized buildings have been constructed, the same by itself cannot be a good ground for allowing other constructional activities to come up which would be in violation of the provisions of the Act. Illegal encroachments, if any, may be removed in accordance with law. It is trite law that thee is no equality in illegality. The Parliamentary Debates, some of which we have noticed hereinbefore, clearly go to show that the Act was enacted with particular objectives in view. Such statutory objects could not have been given a go by. It is not suggested that the Santiniketan should remain as it was in 1921 but it cannot be permitted to become full of concrete jungles and industrial hub. For carrying out further constructional activities, it may not be necessary for a builder to apply to the University for seeking its permission but the local-self government which is responsible therefor must take into consideration the salutary principles laid down in the pollution control laws as well as the Act. The land use and future planning of Santiniketan must be done in such a manner so that the changes be brought about which would not be beyond the recognition of the poet as also the provisions of the Act. SSDA in that sense must distinguish itself from the other development authorities. It has an extra-burden to shoulder. It cannot shut its eyes to the provisions of the Act and the object and purport it seeks to achieve. It cannot ignore the environmental impact assessment made by the Board. It is one thing to say that the SSDA may permit small constructions to be made by the owners of the land or additions or allow alterations to the existing building for residential purposes but it is another thing to say that it would not consider the effect of the changes which may be brought about by turning Santiniketan into a commercial and industrial hub.
