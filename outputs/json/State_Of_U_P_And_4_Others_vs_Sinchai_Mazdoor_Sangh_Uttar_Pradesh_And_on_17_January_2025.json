The claim of the petitioner before the Labour Court was that he was being asked to work as a helper, whereas he was being paid as Chowkidar. Thus, the claim was that difference of the salary should be paid to the petitioner. In the said proceedings, a reply was filed by the respondents accepting that the petitioner continue to work as a helper, however, on 29.12.2014, an order has been passed, which is also reflected in the service book of the petitioner to show that the petitioner shall now work on the post as he was working prior to 1.1.996 on the post of Chowkidar. The claim of the petitioner is that the petitioner should be paid the difference of salary for the period, on which the work of helper was taken from the petitioner and he is entitled to regularization in view of the fact that all persons similarly placed were regularized way back in 1996. The fact is that the petitioner still continues to work as Chowkidar and regularization benefits has not been accorded to the petitioner. The first relief of the petitioner for payment of difference of wages on account of the fact that petitioner had worked as a helper is liable to be rejected on the ground that the petitioner had agitated the same before the Industrial Court in Case No. 10 of 2015.

Rule-8 specifies the category of posts and also specifies the post in Appendix-A. The posts, therefore, which are included within the ambit of the Rules, will fall exclusively within the domain of the Rules and the Certified Standing Orders cannot be said to be applicable in respect of these posts. 11. Learned Additional Advocate General has drawn the attention of the Court towards Rule-25 of the Rules and on that basis, it has been submitted that since no age of retirement has been prescribed under the Rules, therefore, the Certified Standing Orders would be applicable wherein the date of retirement is mentioned as 58 years. 12. The aforesaid argument has to be tested in the light of the language used in Rule-25 of the Rules, which says that in respect of the matters, which have not been provided in these Rules or special orders, the provisions related to State Government employees will apply. The applicability of the Rules has to be tested in the light of the fact that the Certified Standing Orders came into existence after promulgation of the Rules and the appellants consciously framed the Rules so as to place the category of State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025 persons indicated in the Rules outside the ambit of the Certified Standing Orders. The Certified Standing Orders, therefore, in the wake of the Rules framed by the appellants would not apply in respect of the category of employees, who are falling under Rule-8 and Appendix-A of the Rules. 13. The Division Bench of this Court while considering the issue at Allahabad22 was seized with the matter, in respect of which, no Rules were existing and neither framed in respect of Allahabad Workshop. In those very circumstances, the Division Bench came to the conclusion that until and unless there is declaration as contemplated under Section 13-B, the Government Servant Rules will not be applicable, but in the case in hand, the appellants themselves have framed the Rules and the employees have been subjected to the aforesaid Rules, and whatever has not been provided in these Rules, the same will be adopted from the Rules applicable in respect of U.P. State Government employees, so in these circumstances, if the age of retirement has not been provided in these Rules, then the age of retirement, which is applicable in respect of U.P.
