In the opinion of this Court, even if the facts as alleged by the petitioner are taken to be true, no offence whatsoever is made out against the respondents. Reliance placed by the petitioner upon the orders of the CAT fixing a time limit for issuance of a chargesheet is completely misplaced. The direction issued in the order dt.25.10.2010 cannot be construed to mean that once the time limit of four weeks expired on 24.11.2010, no charge-sheet could be issued thereafter or that the disciplinary proceedings would automatically come to an end after 24.11.2010. There is no such stipulation in the said order of the CAT. Even otherwise, the time limit fixed by the CAT was not a relevant fact to be considered by the CVC or the Minister while granting their respective approvals to issue a charge-sheet to the petitioner.
