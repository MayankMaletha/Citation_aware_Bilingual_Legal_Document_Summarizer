Moreover, the severity of the Charges in the present case being grave and severe in nature, as against the ones applicants were charged with in the aforesaid cases, the decisions relied upon by the appellant are not applicable to the facts of the present case. 76. We have also gone through the other decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant and find that they do not come to his aid as in most of the cases, the Charges were not framed and the trial was also in the nascent stages as well as they turn on their own peculiar facts and circumstances of the case thereby not being applicable to the facts of the present case. 77. Notably, the trial in the present case is being fast tracked thereby reducing the delay. The learned Special Judge is also making an endeavour to increase the pace of the trial as is evident from the dates of hearing being given. Moreso, the list of witnesses has also been pruned down by the prosecution, making an attempt to conclude the trial as early as possible. It is also to be noted that Justice hurried is Justice buried. We also cannot lose sight of the element that quality of evidence that is to be adduced before the trial cannot be compromised. 78. In light of the aforesaid and considering the nature of the allegations against the appellant and the evidence brought on record, coupled with the facts that the husband of the appellant is absconding and the bail of the co-accused Masasosang AO was also rejected by the Coordinate Alemla Jamir vs National Investigation Agency on 13 January, 2025 Bench of this Court and was unsuccessfully challenged before the Supreme Court, we do not find any merit in the present appeal. 79. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed. However, we make it clear that nothing observed hereinabove would tantamount to be an expression on merits of the allegations against the appellant.
