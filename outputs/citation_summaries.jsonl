Moreover, the severity of the Charges in the present case being grave and severe in nature, as against the ones applicants were charged with in the aforesaid cases, the decisions relied upon by the appellant are not applicable to the facts of the present case. 76. We have also gone through the other decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant and find that they do not come to his aid as in most of the cases, the Charges were not framed and the trial was also in the nascent stages as well as they turn on their own peculiar facts and circumstances of the case thereby not being applicable to the facts of the present case. 77. Notably, the trial in the present case is being fast tracked thereby reducing the delay. The learned Special Judge is also making an endeavour to increase the pace of the trial as is evident from the dates of hearing being given. Moreso, the list of witnesses has also been pruned down by the prosecution, making an attempt to conclude the trial as early as possible. It is also to be noted that Justice hurried is Justice buried. We also cannot lose sight of the element that quality of evidence that is to be adduced before the trial cannot be compromised. 78. In light of the aforesaid and considering the nature of the allegations against the appellant and the evidence brought on record, coupled with the facts that the husband of the appellant is absconding and the bail of the co-accused Masasosang AO was also rejected by the Coordinate Alemla Jamir vs National Investigation Agency on 13 January, 2025 Bench of this Court and was unsuccessfully challenged before the Supreme Court, we do not find any merit in the present appeal. 79. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed. However, we make it clear that nothing observed hereinabove would tantamount to be an expression on merits of the allegations against the appellant. These observations are tentative and have been made for the purpose of consideration of bail alone.

In the opinion of this Court, even if the facts as alleged by the petitioner are taken to be true, no offence whatsoever is made out against the respondents. Reliance placed by the petitioner upon the orders of the CAT fixing a time limit for issuance of a chargesheet is completely misplaced. The direction issued in the order dt.25.10.2010 cannot be construed to mean that once the time limit of four weeks expired on 24.11.2010, no charge-sheet could be issued thereafter or that the disciplinary proceedings would automatically come to an end after 24.11.2010. There is no such stipulation in the said order of the CAT. Even otherwise, the time limit fixed by the CAT was not a relevant fact to be considered by the CVC or the Minister while granting their respective approvals to issue a charge-sheet to the petitioner.

A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in a manner provided for the transfer of such property by sale.

The word encumbrances means a burden or charge upon property or a claim or lien upon an estate or on the land. Encumber means burden of legal liability on property, and therefore, when there is encumbrance on a land, it constitutes a burden on the title which diminishes the value of the land. But where the land acquired by the State is free from all encumbrances, it vests absolutely and free from all encumbrances. In such a case, it would be an incidence of transfer of ownership from the owner of the land to the Government as there would be divesting of land from its true owner. 14.9 Amongst the distinct kinds of ownerships, a trust ownership and beneficial ownership is relevant to the case.

Carrying on the business of the enemy and dealing with the property of the enemy vested in the Custodian is in order to protect the business belonging to an enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm, who has left the country.

The vesting of property in a trustee or the Custodian which, in the instant case, is enemy property as defined under the Act is for the purpose of managing the said property and protecting it, so that the property does not fall into the hands of trespassers, unauthorised persons or render it as being ownerless and therefore, a free for all, so to say owing to the absence of the owner.

This is by a deeming provision and by a fiction only for the limited purpose of extinction of rights of succession on the death of the enemy or extinction or winding up of the business of enemy property or change of nationality of the legal heir or successor. Thus, if no ownership rights are conferred on the Custodian and he is appointed vis-à-vis any enemy property as a Custodian, in law, he cannot be construed to be the owner of such property. This position is also discerned from the manner in which the Custodian acts vis-à-vis the enemy property as a protector of such property and not as its owner. If the Custodian himself cannot be construed to be the owner of the enemy property, then much less the Central Government or Union can be considered to be the owner of such property. In our view, the Union or the Central Government cannot usurp rights of ownership and exercise all such rights of ownership vis-à-vis enemy property. In the absence of any provision conferring such ownership on the Custodian, the Central Government, which appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India by issuance of a notification in the Official Gazette to carry on his functions under the provisions of the Act, cannot assume ownership rights over such property. The same is having regard to the fact that the Act is a piece of parliamentary legislation and therefore, the State Legislatures or Governments have no competence to take steps under the Act and therefore, the Central Government appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India. 17. However, it was contended by Sri Balbir Singh, learned ASG appearing along with Sri Rupesh Kumar, learned counsel for the Custodian that by the appointment of the Custodian by the Central Government, the powers of the Custodian in respect of enemy property vested in him and such other Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, 2024 actions that he may take vis-à-vis enemy property, would clearly indicate that the Custodian acts at the behest of the Central Government and therefore, the enemy property becomes Union property even though the same is vested in the Custodian who, in any case, is appointed by the Central Government. In order to buttress this submission, our attention was drawn to Section 8-A which begins with a non-obstante clause and which states that the Custodian may, with the approval of the Central Government, dispose of enemy property by sale or otherwise, as the case may be, the enemy property vested in him immediately before the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2017, in accordance with the provisions of the Act as amended by the Amendment Act, 2017. Further, the Custodian, on disposal of enemy property, has to deposit the sale proceeds into the Consolidated Fund of India immediately and intimate details thereof to the Central Government. Also, the Custodian has to submit a report of the enemy properties disposed of enclosing details of sale etc. The Central Government may also issue directions and guidelines to the Custodian in matters related to disposal of enemy property which are binding on the Custodian and the buyer. Moreover, the Central Government may deal with or utilise the enemy property in a manner as it may deem fit. On sale of any enemy property vested in the Custodian to any person he may, on receipt of the sale proceeds of such property, issue a certificate of sale notwithstanding the fact that the original title deeds of the property have not been handed over to that transferee. That once such certificate of sale is issued, the same shall be valid as conclusive proof of ownership of property by such person. Further, the certificate issued by the Custodian shall be a valid instrument for registration of the property in favour of the transferee as the registration in respect of enemy property for which such certificate has been issued by the Custodian, shall not be refused on the ground of lack of original title deeds in respect of such property or for any other matter. 17.1 In our view, although the Custodian for the Enemy Property is empowered to alienate enemy property under the provisions of the Act, he does so as a trustee of the said property and not as the owner thereof or as the Central Government being the owner. As already stated, the ownership continues to remain with the enemy but the management and the custody of the property only remain with the Custodian and in the absence of the enemy, the Custodian is empowered to sell or alienate such property and can issue a sale certificate as is expedient to do so. This is in the interest of or benefit of the enemy property. Thus, the transfer of such enemy property by sale or otherwise is for and on behalf of the enemy who is not available in the country and in order to ensure that such property is not dissipated owing to the owner of the property being absent in the country. Thus in order to protect the enemy property, the Custodian is empowered to even sell the enemy property and deposit the sale proceeds with the Central Government. The sale or transfer of ownership of the enemy property in favour of the transferee is, in fact, on behalf of the enemy who is the owner of the property through the legal and statutory authority of the Custodian which empowers him to alienate the property for good and sound reasons and in the interest of the enemy property irrespective of whether there is any claim made by the enemy or his heirs or descendants. It is for this reason that the original title deeds may remain with the enemy or his family vis-à-vis the enemy property and in lieu of handing over of the title deeds of the property to the vendee or purchaser of the enemy property, a certificate of sale is issued in favour of such person by the Custodian and such certificate of sale is a valid instrument for seeking registration of the property in favour of the transferee. When the registration of the sale is made in favour of the transferee by the Custodian, the latter is acting as a trustee and not as the owner of the enemy property.

Within the scope of Article 300-A the doctrine of eminent domain could also be read inasmuch as the said doctrine states that the acquisition of property must be in the public interest and there must be payment of just and fair compensation therefor. When acquisition of property takes place either under the Land Acquisition Act, 1984 or the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, it is always for a public purpose and on payment of compensation to the owner of the said property. The State then possesses the power to take control of the property of the owner thereof for the benefit of the public and when the State so acts it is obliged to compensate the owner upon making just compensation as the owner of the property would lose all his rights vis-à-vis the acquired land. 18.2 However, this position has to be distinguished vis-à-vis the Custodian for Enemy Property under the Act, as he takes possession of the enemy property only for the purpose of managing the same as per the provisions of the Act and does not become the owner of the property inasmuch as the ownership of the property from the enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm does not get transferred to the Custodian. On the other hand, if it is to be recognised that ownership of the property gets transferred from the enemy to the Custodian who takes possession of the property and administers it or manages it and thereby the ownership would then be that of the Union, in that event, it would be a deprivation of the property of the true owner who may be an enemy or an enemy Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, 2024 subject or enemy firm but such deprivation of property cannot be without payment of compensation. Having regard to the salutary principles of Article 300-A of the Act, we cannot construe the taking possession of the enemy property for the purpose of administration of the same by the Custodian, as an instance of transfer of ownership from the true owner to the Custodian and thereby to the Union.

A buyer of the unit has to fund the cost of construction. A buyer under such a scheme cannot be permitted to buy a unit at a price which is less than the cost of construction. In a self-financing scheme, pricing is generally based on cost of construction unlike sale of houses after they are completed, in which cases pricing is generally market related. In the case of a self-financing scheme, no buyer can claim a right to purchase any unit at a price lower than the actual construction cost, as the board raises its funds in turn from the banks and other financial institutions to whom the board is required to pay interest periodically.

India is having cost-push economy. In a self-financing scheme based on costing, an interim injunction has a cascading effect. Failure on the part of even one contributory in contributing the amount to the cost results in total failure of the project. The developer, like the housing board, makes an initial investment by borrowing funds from the market. Therefore, an interim injunction at the initial stage of the project would result in the total collapse of the entire project. It would also affect the contributions made by other co-purchasers. Several components go into costing, including the lease rent payable to the State Government. These aspects have not been considered by the trial Court. Our observations herein however should not be read to mean that the developer in the present case has an absolute right to increase the cost of flats initially announced as estimated cost. The final cost should be proportionate to the estimated cost mentioned in the offer keeping in mind the rate of inflation, escalation of the prices of inputs, escalation in the prices of the construction material and labour charges.

The High Court has to be satisfied on the materials on record that the Authority has not acted in an arbitrary or erratic manner. 10. So far the facts of the present case are concerned, it is an admitted position that in the pro forma attached to the application for registration, the appellant said that the M.P. Housing Board vs Anil Kumar Khiwani on 14 March, 2005 price mentioned by them was a probable and estimated cost, the definite price shall be intimated at the time of the allotment. Thereafter, the appellant had been informing the respondents and others who had got themselves registered, from time to time regarding the escalation in the cost of the flat. One of the reasons for the rise of the price for the LIG flat from Rs.60,000 to Rs.1,16,000 appears to be the increase in the area of the flat itself from 500 sq. ft. to 714.94 sq. ft. From 1982 to 1984, possession of the flats could not be delivered because of the dispute pending in the Court which also contributed to the increase in the cost of the flat.

It was rightly observed that Section 69 of the Evidence Act does not specify the mode of such proof and, in other words, the handwriting can be spoken to by a person who has acquaintance with the handwriting or the signature can be proved by comparison with the admitted handwriting or signature of the person executing the document. 30.

It was noted that a presumption of fact is an inference logically drawn from one fact as to the existence of AIR 1987 Andhra Pradesh 139 other facts and such presumptions of fact are rebuttable by evidence to the contrary. It was also held that presumptions of law may be either irrebuttable, so that no evidence to a contrary may be given, or rebuttable, and a rebuttable presumption of law is a legal rule to be applied by the Courts in the absence of conflicting evidence. This view was affirmed by this Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Manufacturing Company vs. Amin Chand Payrelal14 and it was held that in order to disprove a presumption, such facts and circumstances have to be brought on record, upon consideration of which, the Court may either believe that the consideration did not exist or its non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the circumstances of the case, act upon the plea that it did not exist. 36.

Ergo, the proving of the validity of the document is a must. 38. Much earlier, in Kishori Lal vs. Mst. Chaltibai16, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court held that, as an adoption results in changing the course of succession, it is necessary that the evidence to support it should be such that it is free from all suspicions of fraud and so consistent and probable as to leave no occasion for doubting its truth. On facts, the Bench found that no invitations were sent to the brotherhood, friends or relations and no publicity was given to the adoption, rendering it difficult to believe. 39.

In Padmalav Achariya and another vs. Srimatyia Fakira Debya and others18, the Privy Council found that a cloud of suspicion rested upon an alleged second adoption and the factum of the second adoption was sought to be proved on the basis of evidence of near relatives who were also partisan, which made it unsafe to act upon their testimonies.

At that stage, the trial judge has to merely examine the evidence placed by the prosecution in order to determine whether or not the grounds are sufficient to proceed against the accused on basis of charge sheet material. The nature of the evidence recorded or collected by the investigating agency or the documents produced in which prima facie it reveals that there are suspicious circumstances against the accused, so as to frame a charge would suffice and such material would be taken into account for the purposes of framing the charge. If there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused necessarily, the accused would be discharged, but if the court is of the opinion, after such consideration of the material there are grounds for presuming that accused has committed the offence which is triable, then necessarily charge has to be framed. 8. At the time of framing of the charge and taking cognizance the accused has no right to produce any material and call upon the court to examine the same. No provision in the Code grants any right to the accused to file any material or document at the stage of framing of charge. The trial court has to apply its judicial mind to the facts of the case as may be necessary to determine whether a case has been made out by the prosecution for trial on the basis of charge-sheet material only. 9. If the accused is able to demonstrate from the charge-sheet material at the stage of framing the charge which might drastically affect the very sustainability of the case, it is unfair to suggest that such material should not be considered or ignored by the court at that stage. The main intention of granting a chance to the accused of making submissions as envisaged under Section 227 of the Cr. P.C. is to assist the court to determine whether it is required to proceed to conduct the trial. Nothing in the Code limits the ambit of such hearing, to oral hearing and oral arguments only and therefore, the trial court can consider the material produced by the accused before the I.O. 10. It is settled principle of law that at the stage of considering an application for discharge the court must proceed on an assumption that the material which has been brought on record by the prosecution is true and evaluate said material in order to determine whether the facts emerging from the material taken on its face value, disclose the existence of the ingredients necessary of the offence alleged. ... xxx Pramod Kumar Alias Sanjay And Others vs State Of U.P.

Though there is a conflict of judicial opinion about the power of a Court to grant anticipatory bail, the majority view is that there is no such power under the existing provisions of the Code. The necessity for granting anticipatory bail arises mainly because sometimes influential persons try to implicate their rivals in false causes for the purpose of disgracing them or for other purposes by getting them detained in jail for some days. In recent times, with the accentuation of political rivalry, this tendency is showing signs of steady increase. Apart from false cases, where there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely to abscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail, there seems no justification to require him first to submit to custody, remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail. We recommend the acceptance of this suggestion.

The stage of investigation has a bearing on the conditions to be imposed while granting the relief of anticipatory bail. 10.9 A crucial difference between the pre-arrest bail order under Section 438 of CrPC and the bail order under Sections 437 and 439 of CrPC is the stages at which the bail order is passed. 11. Greater clarity on the contours of judicial discretion in the grant of pre-arrest bail emerged out of the judgement of the Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Gurbaksh Singh Sibia vs. State of Punjab, 1977 SCC OnLine P&H 157. The Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court had rejected the application for bail while furnishing the reasons that the power under Section 438 of CrPC is of an extraordinary character and must be exercised sparingly in exceptional cases.

On account of failure to do so, we would have, in the normal course, quashed the order of the Magistrate taking cognizance and directed him to consider the question of applicability of Section 473. However, having regard to the Ramesh And Ors vs State Of Tamil Nadu on 3 March, 2005 facts and circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to exercise our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution to remit the matter to the trial court for taking a decision on this aspect.

In complaints under Section 498-A the wife will invariably be oppressed, having been subjected to cruelty by the husband and the in-laws.

When the conduct of the accused is such that applying the rule of limitation will give an unfair advantage to him or result in miscarriage of justice, the court may take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of the period of limitation in the interests of justice. This is only illustrative, not exhaustive. No doubt, the Court directed the Magistrate to consider the question of limitation taking note of Section 473 Cr.P.C. in the light of the observations made in the judgment. In the instant case, however, the same course need not be adopted. That was a case in which the complaint alleging ofence under Section 498-A itself was filed nearly 7 years after the aggrieved spouse was kept out of the matrimonial home without any explanation for delay. That is why the matter was remanded to the Magistrate for reconsideration. In the present case, such a course is unnecessary and inexpedient.

It is alleged that when the relations of the informant met her in-laws at a hotel in Chennai where they were staying on 13.10.1998, there was again a demand for dowry and a threat to torture her in case she was sent back to Mumbai without the money and articles demanded.

Just focus on one thing. When Srinijan gave affidavit for participating in the competition he had to struggle to gather money because he had lots of black money. If he were to use it, he would get caught. So, he needed money in his account, so it is said that he borrowed money from some movie producers to show in record.

A distinguished former Attorney General for India, M.C. Setalvad in his treatise War and Civil Liberties observed that the French Convention stipulates common happiness as the end of the society, whereas Bentham postulates the greatest happiness of the greatest number as the end of law. Article 19 of the Indian Constitution averts to freedom and it enumerates certain rights regarding individual freedom. These rights are vital and most important freedoms which lie at the very root of liberty. He further observed that the concept of civil liberty is essentially rooted in the philosophy of individualism. According to this doctrine, the highest development of the individual and the enrichment of his personality are the true function and end of the State. It is only when the individual has reached the highest state of perfection and evolved what is best in him that society and the State can reach their goal of perfection. In brief, according to this doctrine, the State exists mainly, if not solely, for the purpose of affording the individual freedom and assistance for the attainment of his growth and perfection.

Despite various measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain vulnerable. They are denied number of civil rights. They are subjected to various offences, indignities, humiliations and harassment. They have, in several brutal incidents, been deprived of their life and property. Serious crimes are committed against them for various historical, social and economic reasons. 2. Because of the awareness created amongst the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes through spread of education, etc. they are trying to assert their rights and this is not being taken very kindly by the others. When they assert their rights and resist practices of untouchability against them or demand statutory minimum wages or refuse to do any bonded and forced labour, the vested interests try to cow them down and terrorise them. When the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes try to preserve their self-respect or honour of their women, they become irritants for the dominant and the mighty. Occupation and cultivation of even the Government allotted land by the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes is resented and more often these people become victims of attacks by the vested interests. Of late, there has been an increase in the disturbing trend of commission of certain atrocities like making the Scheduled Castes persons eat inedible substances like human excreta and attacks on and mass killings of helpless Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and rape of women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.

It has not come out of its colonial image despite six decades of Independence, it is largely considered as a tool of harassment, oppression and surely not considered a friend of public. The need for caution in exercising the drastic power of arrest has been emphasised time and again by the courts but has not yielded desired result. Power to arrest greatly contributes to its arrogance so also the failure of the Magistracy to check it. Not only this, the power of arrest is one of the lucrative sources of police corruption. The attitude to arrest first and then proceed with the rest is despicable. It has become a handy tool to the police officers who lack sensitivity or act with oblique motive. 6. Law Commissions, Police Commissions and this Court in a large number of judgments emphasised the need to maintain a balance between individual liberty and societal order while exercising the power of arrest. Police officers make arrest as they believe that they possess the power to do so. As the arrest curtails freedom, brings humiliation and casts scars forever, we feel differently. We believe that no arrest should be made only because the offence is non-bailable and cognizable and therefore, lawful for the police officers to do so. The existence of the power to arrest is one thing, the justification for the exercise of it is quite another. Apart from the power to arrest, the police officers must be able to justify the reasons thereof. Shajan Skaria vs The State Of Kerala on 23 August, 2024 No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a person. It would be prudent and wise for a police officer that no arrest is made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the genuineness of the allegation.

The claim of the petitioner before the Labour Court was that he was being asked to work as a helper, whereas he was being paid as Chowkidar. Thus, the claim was that difference of the salary should be paid to the petitioner. In the said proceedings, a reply was filed by the respondents accepting that the petitioner continue to work as a helper, however, on 29.12.2014, an order has been passed, which is also reflected in the service book of the petitioner to show that the petitioner shall now work on the post as he was working prior to 1.1.996 on the post of Chowkidar. The claim of the petitioner is that the petitioner should be paid the difference of salary for the period, on which the work of helper was taken from the petitioner and he is entitled to regularization in view of the fact that all persons similarly placed were regularized way back in 1996. The fact is that the petitioner still continues to work as Chowkidar and regularization benefits has not been accorded to the petitioner. The first relief of the petitioner for payment of difference of wages on account of the fact that petitioner had worked as a helper is liable to be rejected on the ground that the petitioner had agitated the same before the Industrial Court in Case No. 10 of 2015.

The appellants in their own wisdom has taken a decision to make the service Rules in 1984 and those Rules have been prevailing since then. Rule-8 specifies the category of posts and also specifies the post in Appendix-A. The posts, therefore, which are included within the ambit of the Rules, will fall exclusively within the domain of the Rules and the Certified Standing Orders cannot be said to be applicable in respect of these posts. 11. Learned Additional Advocate General has drawn the attention of the Court towards Rule-25 of the Rules and on that basis, it has been submitted that since no age of retirement has been prescribed under the Rules, therefore, the Certified Standing Orders would be applicable wherein the date of retirement is mentioned as 58 years. 12. The aforesaid argument has to be tested in the light of the language used in Rule-25 of the Rules, which says that in respect of the matters, which have not been provided in these Rules or special orders, the provisions related to State Government employees will apply. The applicability of the Rules has to be tested in the light of the fact that the Certified Standing Orders came into existence after promulgation of the Rules and the appellants consciously framed the Rules so as to place the category of State Of U.P.

The Certified Standing Orders, therefore, in the wake of the Rules framed by the appellants would not apply in respect of the category of employees, who are falling under Rule-8 and Appendix-A of the Rules. 13. The Division Bench of this Court while considering the issue at Allahabad22 was seized with the matter, in respect of which, no Rules were existing and neither framed in respect of Allahabad Workshop. In those very circumstances, the Division Bench came to the conclusion that until and unless there is declaration as contemplated under Section 13-B, the Government Servant Rules will not be applicable, but in the case in hand, the appellants themselves have framed the Rules and the employees have been subjected to the aforesaid Rules, and whatever has not been provided in these Rules, the same will be adopted from the Rules applicable in respect of U.P. State Government employees, so in these circumstances, if the age of retirement has not been provided in these Rules, then the age of retirement, which is applicable in respect of U.P.

On 21st July, 2011 CBI supplied the copies of complete charge sheet, documents and statements in a DVD to all the accused persons. Thereafter, a request was made by the accused persons that hyper-linking be done for which CBI sought time. On 5th August, 2011 E-copies of the challans with hyperlink were furnished to the accused persons. In the meantime, three other accused surrendered before the Trial Court and E-copies of the challans were served upon them. Since some of the accused are still not available for trial, the CBI moved an application for separation of the trial, which was opposed by the Petitioners and other accused.

Learned counsel for the CBI has strenuously contended that the witnesses were threatened and harassed by the Petitioners who permitted every course of action to be taken only as per their desire. In this regard statements of PW-1 Sujit Panigrahi, PW-2 V.K. Gautam and PW-6 V.K. Saxena have been relied upon. PW-1 Sujit Panigrahi has alleged that he was harassed and totally sidelined in all the matters. The witness was issued a memo with false allegations resulting in the witness giving resignation to the Petitioner Suresh Kalmadi on 26th November, 2009. The resignation was not Suresh Kalmadi vs Cbi on 19 January, 2012 accepted at that time and further harassment followed. The witness even asked for being relieved on health grounds as the maltreatment was affecting him and finally on 20th January, 2010 he was relieved of his duty and one Sandeep Arya was brought in, who could manage the things as per the desire of the Petitioners and co-accused. PW-2 V.K. Gautam has stated that due to falsification and manipulation of records, heated arguments ensued between him and V.K. Verma the Petitioner herein, and he threatened to expose the manipulation. However, the Petitioner V.K. Verma contemptuously stated that he was not bothered about it and PW-2 could do what he wanted. PW-2 was removed from the OCFC on 6th November, 2009. PW-2 also had an exchange of words with the Petitioner Suresh Kalmadi on 13th October, 2009 whereafter the work of Technology F.A. was taken away from him and he was put under V.K. Verma. According to this witness the situation in O.C. became so unbearable that he proceeded on long leave from 20th December, 2009", "summary_en": "<extra_id_0>.", "summary_en_sentences": ["<extra_id_0>."], "summary_hi_sentences": ["<R_id_0>."], "summary_hi": "<R_id_0>."}

PW-1 Sujit Panigrahi who was also Technology expert agreed with the views of PW-6. Thereafter, Petitioner Suresh Kalmadi got angry with PW-6 and expressed his displeasure by observing that he knew how to get it corrected. 15. Thus, in nutshell the allegations of threatening the witnesses and tampering with the evidence are when the witnesses were working under the Petitioners and they were threatened and harassed to toe the line of the Petitioners. However, whether the said threat can raise an apprehension that the Petitioners are likely to influence the witnesses during the trial is an issue which has to be examined by this Court. It may be noted that the statements of these witnesses i.e. PW-1, PW-2 and PW-6 were recorded by the CBI when the Petitioners had not been arrested. Thus, it is apparent that the witnesses were harassed and threatened only till they were working under the Petitioners. Thereafter there was no influence on the witnesses and they made their statements fearlessly before the CBI. Thus, the evidence on record that in the past witnesses were intimidated does not prima facie shows that there is any likelihood of threat to the prosecution witnesses. I find no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the CBI that the mere presence of the Petitioners at large would intimidate the witnesses. Further one co-accused who was actually found influencing the prosecution witness is not the Petitioner before this Court. 16. As regards delay in trial, it may be noted that the charge sheet was filed on the 20th May, 2011 and thereafter twice supplementary charge sheets with list of witnesses and documents have been filed. After the charge sheet was filed, time was consumed in providing it in E-form with hyperlinking. After the scrutiny of the supplementary charge, the matter will now be listed for arguments on charge. Though the learned Trial Court has directed that the trial be conducted on day to day basis, however, in the main charge sheet itself 49 witnesses have been cited. Thereafter, further witnesses have been cited in the two supplementary charge sheets. Thus, the trial is likely to take time.

Despite holding so, the High Court observed that such changes are necessary having regard to the continued increase in population of Santiniketan and, as the Act does not contain any provision Santiniketan was required to be made an exclusive spot forever and, furthermore, as allowing the Santiniketan in its original form would be impractical, it can be permitted to become residential town or even industrial town provided the growth is planned, systematic and in accordance with the laws relating to freedom from population.

What is being objected to by them is constructions of huge Sushanta Tagore & Ors vs Uoi&Ors on 3 March, 2005 residential and commercial complexes which even according to the High Court would not only change the topography but also would change the place almost beyond the recognition of the poet. It may be true that the development of a town is the job of the town planning authority but the same should conform to the requirements of law. Development must be sustainable in nature. A land use plan should be prepared not only having regard to the provisions contained in the 1979 Act and the rules and regulations framed thereunder but also the provisions of other statues enacted therefor and in particular those for protection and preservation of ecology and environment. As Visva Bharati has the unique distinction of being not only a University of national importance but also a unitary one, the SSDA should be well-advised to keep in mind the provisions of the Act, the object and purpose for which it has been enacted as also the report of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. It is sui generis. It is idle to compare Shantiniketan with any other university. Truism is that Shantiniketan has unique features. Its environmental ambiance, thus, must be maintained. There is no other university which having regard to the purport and object of the Act, as would appear from the objects and reasons thereof, can be compared with Visva Bharati. Our attention has not been drawn to any other statute establishing any university which has such unique features as Visva Bharati. Only because some advantages would ensue to the people in general by reason of the proposed development, the same would not mean that the ecology of the place would be sacrificed. Only because some encroachments have been made and unauthorized buildings have been constructed, the same by itself cannot be a good ground for allowing other constructional activities to come up which would be in violation of the provisions of the Act. Illegal encroachments, if any, may be removed in accordance with law. It is trite law that thee is no equality in illegality. The Parliamentary Debates, some of which we have noticed hereinbefore, clearly go to show that the Act was enacted with particular objectives in view. Such statutory objects could not have been given a go by. It is not suggested that the Santiniketan should remain as it was in 1921 but it cannot be permitted to become full of concrete jungles and industrial hub. For carrying out further constructional activities, it may not be necessary for a builder to apply to the University for seeking its permission but the local-self government which is responsible therefor must take into consideration the salutary principles laid down in the pollution control laws as well as the Act. The land use and future planning of Santiniketan must be done in such a manner so that the changes be brought about which would not be beyond the recognition of the poet as also the provisions of the Act. SSDA in that sense must distinguish itself from the other development authorities. It has an extra-burden to shoulder.

Whether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

Although the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances. The intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc. 27. For the conviction under Section 307 IPC more importance has been given to mens rea or the intention than the actus reus or the actual act itself. The attempt should arise out of a specific intention or desire to murder the victim. The nature of the weapon used, the manner in which it is used, motive for the crime, severity of the blow, the part of the body where the injury is inflicted is all taken into consideration to determine the intention.
