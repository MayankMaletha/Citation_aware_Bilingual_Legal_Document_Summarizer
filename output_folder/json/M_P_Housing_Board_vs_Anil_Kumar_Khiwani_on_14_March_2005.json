In a self-financing scheme based on costing, an interim injunction has a cascading effect. Failure on the part of even one contributory in contributing the amount to the cost results in total failure of the project. The developer, like the housing board, makes an initial investment by borrowing funds from the market. Therefore, an interim injunction at the initial stage of the project would result in the total collapse of the entire project. It would also affect the contributions made by other co-purchasers. Several components go into costing, including the lease rent payable to the State Government. These aspects have not been considered by the trial Court. Our observations herein however should not be read to mean that the developer in the present case has an absolute right to increase the cost of flats initially announced as estimated cost. The final cost should be proportionate to the estimated cost mentioned in the offer keeping in mind the rate of inflation, escalation of the prices of inputs, escalation in the prices of the construction material and labour charges. These factors have got to be taken into account on the basis of the evidence which may be considered at the time of final hearing of the suit. In the present case, however, the appellant M.P.
