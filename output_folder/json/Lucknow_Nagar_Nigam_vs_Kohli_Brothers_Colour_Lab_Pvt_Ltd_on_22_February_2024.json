This Court in Fruit and Vegetable Merchants Union, Subzi Mandi, Delhi vs. Delhi Improvement Trust, Regal Buildings, Cannaught Place, AIR 1957 SC 344 has held that the property acquired becomes the property of the Government without any conditions or limitations either as to title or possession when it vests free from all encumbrances in the Government. The word encumbrances means a burden or charge upon property or a claim or lien upon an estate or on the land. Encumber means burden of legal liability on property, and therefore, when there is encumbrance on a land, it constitutes a burden on the title which diminishes the value of the land. But where the land acquired by the State is free from all encumbrances, it vests absolutely and free from all encumbrances. In such a case, it would be an incidence of transfer of ownership from the owner of the land to the Government as there would be divesting of land from its true owner. 14.9 Amongst the distinct kinds of ownerships, a trust ownership and beneficial ownership is relevant to the case.

This Court in Fruit and Vegetable Merchants Union, Subzi Mandi, Delhi vs. Delhi Improvement Trust, Regal Buildings, Cannaught Place, AIR 1957 SC 344 has held that the property acquired becomes the property of the Government without any conditions or limitations either as to title or possession when it vests free from all encumbrances in the Government. The word encumbrances means a burden or charge upon property or a claim or lien upon an estate or on the land. Encumber means burden of legal liability on property, and therefore, when there is encumbrance on a land, it constitutes a burden on the title which diminishes the value of the land. But where the land acquired by the State is free from all encumbrances, it vests absolutely and free from all encumbrances. In such a case, it would be an incidence of transfer of ownership from the owner of the land to the Government as there would be divesting of land from its true owner. 14.9 Amongst the distinct kinds of ownerships, a trust ownership and beneficial ownership is relevant to the case. A trust is a very important and curious instance of duplicate ownership. According to Salmond, the trust property is that which is owned Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, ",

Thus, if no ownership rights are conferred on the Custodian and he is appointed vis-à-vis any enemy property as a Custodian, in law, he cannot be construed to be the owner of such property. This position is also discerned from the manner in which the Custodian acts vis-à-vis the enemy property as a protector of such property and not as its owner.

In the absence of any provision conferring such ownership on the Custodian, the Central Government, which appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India by issuance of a notification in the Official Gazette to carry on his functions under the provisions of the Act, cannot assume ownership rights over such property.

Further, the Custodian, on disposal of enemy property, has to deposit the sale proceeds into the Consolidated Fund of India immediately and intimate details thereof to the Central Government.

Moreover, the Central Government may deal with or utilise the enemy property in a manner as it may deem fit. On sale of any enemy property vested in the Custodian to any person he may, on receipt of the sale proceeds of such property, issue a certificate of sale notwithstanding the fact that the original title deeds of the property have not been handed over to that transferee. That once such certificate of sale is issued, the same shall be valid as conclusive proof of ownership of property by such person. Further, the certificate issued by the Custodian shall be a valid instrument for registration of the property in favour of the transferee as the registration in respect of enemy property for which such certificate has been issued by the Custodian, shall not be refused on the ground of lack of original title deeds in respect of such property or for any other matter. 17.1 In our view, although the Custodian for the Enemy Property is empowered to alienate enemy property under the provisions of the Act, he does so as a trustee of the said property and not as the owner thereof or as the Central Government being the owner. As already stated, the ownership continues to remain with the enemy but the management and the custody of the property only remain with the Custodian and in the absence of the enemy, the Custodian is empowered to sell or alienate such property and can issue a sale certificate as is expedient to do so. This is in the interest of or benefit of the enemy property. Thus, the transfer of such enemy property by sale or otherwise is for and on behalf of the enemy who is not available in the country and in order to ensure that such property is not dissipated owing to the owner of the property being absent in the country. Thus in order to protect the enemy property, the Custodian is empowered to even sell the enemy property and deposit the sale proceeds with the Central Government. The sale or transfer of ownership of the enemy property in favour of the transferee is, in fact, on behalf of the enemy who is the owner of the property through the legal and statutory authority of the Custodian which empowers him to alienate the property for good and sound reasons and in the interest of the enemy property irrespective of whether there is any claim made by the enemy or his heirs or descendants. It is for this reason that the original title deeds may remain with the enemy or his family vis-à-vis the enemy property and in lieu of handing over of the title deeds of the property to the vendee or purchaser of the enemy property, a certificate of sale is issued in favour of such person by the Custodian and such certificate of sale is a valid instrument for seeking registration of the property in favour of the transferee. When the registration of the sale is made in favour of the transferee by the Custodian, the latter is acting as a trustee and not as the owner of the enemy property.

Thus, the transfer of such enemy property by sale or otherwise is for and on behalf of the enemy who is not available in the country and in order to ensure that such property is not dissipated owing to the owner of the property being absent in the country. Thus in order to protect the enemy property, the Custodian is empowered to even sell the enemy property and deposit the sale proceeds with the Central Government. The sale or transfer of ownership of the enemy property in favour of the transferee is, in fact, on behalf of the enemy who is the owner of the property through the legal and statutory authority of the Custodian which empowers him to alienate the property for good and sound reasons and in the interest of the enemy property irrespective of whether there is any claim made by the enemy or his heirs or descendants. It is for this reason that the original title deeds may remain with the enemy or his family vis-à-vis the enemy property and in lieu of handing over of the title deeds of the property to the vendee or purchaser of the enemy property, a certificate of sale is issued in favour of such person by the Custodian and such certificate of sale is a valid instrument for seeking registration of the property in favour of the transferee. When the registration of the sale is made in favour of the transferee by the Custodian, the latter is acting as a trustee and not as the owner of the enemy property. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, ",

This is by a deeming provision and by a fiction only for the limited purpose of extinction of rights of succession on the death of the enemy or extinction or winding up of the business of enemy property or change of nationality of the legal heir or successor. Thus, if no ownership rights are conferred on the Custodian and he is appointed vis-à-vis any enemy property as a Custodian, in law, he cannot be construed to be the owner of such property. This position is also discerned from the manner in which the Custodian acts vis-à-vis the enemy property as a protector of such property and not as its owner. If the Custodian himself cannot be construed to be the owner of the enemy property, then much less the Central Government or Union can be considered to be the owner of such property. In our view, the Union or the Central Government cannot usurp rights of ownership and exercise all such rights of ownership vis-à-vis enemy property. In the absence of any provision conferring such ownership on the Custodian, the Central Government, which appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India by issuance of a notification in the Official Gazette to carry on his functions under the provisions of the Act, cannot assume ownership rights over such property. The same is having regard to the fact that the Act is a piece of parliamentary legislation and therefore, the State Legislatures or Governments have no competence to take steps under the Act and therefore, the Central Government appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India. 17. However, it was contended by Sri Balbir Singh, learned ASG appearing along with Sri Rupesh Kumar, learned counsel for the Custodian that by the appointment of the Custodian by the Central Government, the powers of the Custodian in respect of enemy property vested in him and such other Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, 2024 actions that he may take vis-à-vis enemy property, would clearly indicate that the Custodian acts at the behest of the Central Government and therefore, the enemy property becomes Union property even though the same is vested in the Custodian who, in any case, is appointed by the Central Government. In order to buttress this submission, our attention was drawn to Section 8-A which begins with a non-obstante clause and which states that the Custodian may, with the approval of the Central Government, dispose of enemy property by sale or otherwise, as the case may be, the enemy property vested in him immediately before the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2017, in accordance with the provisions of the Act as amended by the Amendment Act, 2017. Further, the Custodian, on disposal of enemy property, has to deposit the sale proceeds into the Consolidated Fund of India immediately and intimate details thereof to the Central Government. Also, the Custodian has to submit a report of the enemy properties disposed of enclosing details of sale etc. The Central Government may also issue directions and guidelines to the Custodian in matters related to disposal of enemy property which are binding on the Custodian and the buyer. Moreover, the Central Government may deal with or utilise the enemy property in a manner as it may deem fit. On sale of any enemy property vested in the Custodian to any person he may, on receipt of the sale proceeds of such property, issue a certificate of sale notwithstanding the fact that the original title deeds of the property have not been handed over to that transferee. That once such certificate of sale is issued, the same shall be valid as conclusive proof of ownership of property by such person. Further, the certificate issued by the Custodian shall be a valid instrument for registration of the property in favour of the transferee as the registration in respect of enemy property for which such certificate has been issued by the Custodian, shall not be refused on the ground of lack of original title deeds in respect of such property or for any other matter. 17.1 In our view, although the Custodian for the Enemy Property is empowered to alienate enemy property under the provisions of the Act, he does so as a trustee of the said property and not as the owner thereof or as the Central Government being the owner. As already stated, the ownership continues to remain with the enemy but the management and the custody of the property only remain with the Custodian and in the absence of the enemy, the Custodian is empowered to sell or alienate such property and can issue a sale certificate as is expedient to do so. This is in the interest of or benefit of the enemy property. Thus, the transfer of such enemy property by sale or otherwise is for and on behalf of the enemy who is not available in the country and in order to ensure that such property is not dissipated owing to the owner of the property being absent in the country. Thus in order to protect the enemy property, the Custodian is empowered to even sell the enemy property and deposit the sale proceeds with the Central Government. The sale or transfer of ownership of the enemy property in favour of the transferee is, in fact, on behalf of the enemy who is the owner of the property through the legal and statutory authority of the Custodian which empowers him to alienate the property for good and sound reasons and in the interest of the enemy property irrespective of whether there is any claim made by the enemy or his heirs or descendants. It is for this reason that the original title deeds may remain with the enemy or his family vis-à-vis the enemy property and in lieu of handing over of the title deeds of the property to the vendee or purchaser of the enemy property, a certificate of sale is issued in favour of such person by the Custodian and such certificate of sale is a valid instrument for seeking registration of the property in favour of the transferee. When the registration of the sale is made in favour of the transferee by the Custodian, the latter is acting as a trustee and not as the owner of the enemy property. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, 2024",

Such acceptance must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is void. The donor is the person who gives. Any person who is sui juris can make a gift of his property. Therefore, it is only a person who is the owner of the property, can gift his property and according to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. 14.5 In the same vein, an exchange is when an exchange of immovable property takes place when two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another, neither thing or both things being money only. A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in a manner provided for the transfer of such property by sale. In the case of an exchange also, the person must have the ownership in the property before the same can be exchanged for any immovable property. 14.6 Similarly, transfer of ownership of movable property is by sale, gift or exchange and in the case of a sale, the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930",

This Court in Fruit and Vegetable Merchants Union, Subzi Mandi, Delhi vs. Delhi Improvement Trust, Regal Buildings, Cannaught Place, AIR 1957 SC 344 has held that the property acquired becomes the property of the Government without any conditions or limitations either as to title or possession when it vests free from all encumbrances in the Government. The word encumbrances means a burden or charge upon property or a claim or lien upon an estate or on the land. Encumber means burden of legal liability on property, and therefore, when there is encumbrance on a land, it constitutes a burden on the title which diminishes the value of the land. But where the land acquired by the State is free from all encumbrances, it vests absolutely and free from all encumbrances. In such a case, it would be an incidence of transfer of ownership from the owner of the land to the Government as there would be divesting of land from its true owner. 14.9 Amongst the distinct kinds of ownerships, a trust ownership and beneficial ownership is relevant to the case.

Carrying on the business of the enemy and dealing with the property of the enemy vested in the Custodian is in order to protect the business belonging to an enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm, who has left the country. The Custodian of Enemy Property for India who acts on behalf of the Enemy holds in trust the enemy property vested in him under the provisions of the Act. He does so as a trustee and therefore, the principles and legal doctrines applicable to a trustee are applicable to the Custodian accordingly. 15.9 It is trite that a trustee or Custodian in the instant case can never be the owner of the property. The vesting of property in a trustee or the Custodian which, in the instant case, is enemy property as defined under the Act is for the purpose of managing the said property and protecting it, so that the property does not fall into the hands of trespassers, unauthorised persons or render it as being ownerless and therefore, a free for all, so to say owing to the absence of the owner. The object and purpose of the Act is to ensure that the enemy property, which vests in the Custodian, is held in trust and is looked after, protected and managed as per the provisions of the Act.

      "raw": "shall always be deemed to have included all rights, titles and interests in or any benefit arising out of such property vested in him under the Act. This is by a deeming provision and by a fiction only for the limited purpose of extinction of rights of succession on the death of the enemy or extinction or winding up of the business of enemy property or change of nationality of the legal heir or successor. Thus, if no ownership rights are conferred on the Custodian and he is appointed vis-à-vis any enemy property as a Custodian, in law, he cannot be construed to be the owner of such property. This position is also discerned from the manner in which the Custodian acts vis-à-vis the enemy property as a protector of such property and not as its owner. If the Custodian himself cannot be construed to be the owner of the enemy property, then much less the Central Government or Union can be considered to be the owner of such property. In our view, the Union or the Central Government cannot usurp rights of ownership and exercise all such rights of ownership vis-à-vis enemy property. In the absence of any provision conferring such ownership on the Custodian, the Central Government, which appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India by issuance of a notification in the Official Gazette to carry on his functions under the provisions of the Act, cannot assume ownership rights over such property. The same is having regard to the fact that the Act is a piece of parliamentary legislation and therefore, the State Legislatures or Governments have no competence to take steps under the Act and therefore, the Central Government appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India. 17. However, it was contended by Sri Balbir Singh, learned ASG appearing along with Sri Rupesh Kumar, learned counsel for the Custodian that by the appointment of the Custodian by the Central Government, the powers of the Custodian in respect of enemy property vested in him and such other Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, 2024 actions that he may take vis-à-vis enemy property, would clearly indicate that the Custodian acts at the behest of the Central Government and therefore, the enemy property becomes Union property even though the same is vested in the Custodian who, in any case, is appointed by the Central Government. In order to buttress this submission, our attention was drawn to Section 8-A which begins with a non-obstante clause and which states that the Custodian may, with the approval of the Central Government, dispose of enemy property by sale or otherwise, as the case may be, the enemy property vested in him immediately before the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2017, in accordance with the provisions of the Act as amended by the Amendment Act, 2017. Further, the Custodian, on disposal of enemy property, has to deposit the sale proceeds into the Consolidated Fund of India immediately and intimate details thereof to the Central Government. Also, the Custodian has to submit a report of the enemy properties disposed of enclosing details of sale etc. The Central Government may also issue directions and guidelines to the Custodian in matters related to disposal of enemy property which are binding on the Custodian and the buyer. Moreover, the Central Government may deal with or utilise the enemy property in a manner as it may deem fit. On sale of any enemy property vested in the Custodian to any person he may, on receipt of the sale proceeds of such property, issue a certificate of sale notwithstanding the fact that the original title deeds of the property have not been handed over to that transferee. That once such certificate of sale is issued, the same shall be valid as conclusive proof of ownership of property by such person. Further, the certificate issued by the Custodian shall be a valid instrument for registration of the property in favour of the transferee as the registration in respect of enemy property for which such certificate has been issued by the Custodian, shall not be refused on the ground of lack of original title deeds in respect of such property or for any other matter. 17.1 In our view, although the Custodian for the Enemy Property is empowered to alienate enemy property under the provisions of the Act, he does so as a trustee of the said property and not as the owner thereof or as the Central Government being the owner. As already stated, the ownership continues to remain with the enemy but the management and the custody of the property only remain with the Custodian and in the absence of the enemy, the Custodian is empowered to sell or alienate such property and can issue a sale certificate as is expedient to do so. This is in the interest of or benefit of the enemy property. Thus, the transfer of such enemy property by sale or otherwise is for and on behalf of the enemy who is not available in the country and in order to ensure that such property is not dissipated owing to the owner of the property being absent in the country. Thus in order to protect the enemy property, the Custodian is empowered to even sell the enemy property and deposit the sale proceeds with the Central Government. The sale or transfer of ownership of the enemy property in favour of the transferee is, in fact, on behalf of the enemy who is the owner of the property through the legal and statutory authority of the Custodian which empowers him to alienate the property for good and sound reasons and in the interest of the enemy property irrespective of whether there is any claim made by the enemy or his heirs or descendants. It is for this reason that the original title deeds may remain with the enemy or his family vis-à-vis the enemy property and in lieu of handing over of the title deeds of the property to the vendee or purchaser of the enemy property, a certificate of sale is issued in favour of such person by the Custodian and such certificate of sale is a valid instrument for seeking registration of the property in favour of the transferee. When the registration of the sale is made in favour of the transferee by the Custodian, the latter is acting as a trustee and not as the owner of the enemy property.

      "raw": "it was observed that though the right to claim compensation or the obligation of the State to pay compensation to a person who is deprived of his property is not expressly included in Article 300-A of the Constitution, it is in- built in the Article. Within the scope of Article 300-A the doctrine of eminent domain could also be read inasmuch as the said doctrine states that the acquisition of property must be in the public interest and there must be payment of just and fair compensation therefor. When acquisition of property takes place either under the Land Acquisition Act, 1984 or the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, it is always for a public purpose and on payment of compensation to the owner of the said property. The State then possesses the power to take control of the property of the owner thereof for the benefit of the public and when the State so acts it is obliged to compensate the owner upon making just compensation as the owner of the property would lose all his rights vis-à-vis the acquired land. 18.2 However, this position has to be distinguished vis-à-vis the Custodian for Enemy Property under the Act, as he takes possession of the enemy property only for the purpose of managing the same as per the provisions of the Act and does not become the owner of the property inasmuch as the ownership of the property from the enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm does not get transferred to the Custodian. On the other hand, if it is to be recognised that ownership of the property gets transferred from the enemy to the Custodian who takes possession of the property and administers it or manages it and thereby the ownership would then be that of the Union, in that event, it would be a deprivation of the property of the true owner who may be an enemy or an enemy Lucknow Nagar Nigam vs Kohli Brothers Colour Lab Pvt Ltd on 22 February, 2024 subject or enemy firm but such deprivation of property cannot be without payment of compensation. Having regard to the salutary principles of Article 300-A of the Act, we cannot construe the taking possession of the enemy property for the purpose of administration of the same by the Custodian, as an instance of transfer of ownership from the true owner to the Custodian and thereby to the Union. This position is totally unlike the position under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or the subsequent legislation of 2013",
