He has converted a contractual dispute into multiple criminal cases. ii. It is highlighted that both the matters arise out of the same contract and the same arbitration proceedings. The allegations are also similar, i.e., use of Hero MotoCorp Limited seal for attesting the true copy of documents which were belonging to Hero Honda Motors Limited, the predecessor in the interest company. The use of the said seal is stated to be only due to a name change which took place and all the allegations in the criminal complaint being filed are on the basis of the said true copy attestation. iii. Mr. Dayan Krishnan, ld. Counsel also points out that even recently another notice has been issued by Mr. Pandey on 15 th December, 2024 to the entire board of directors of HML, making allegations of forgery of the Board Resolution. In this manner, Mr. Pandey continues to harass the company as also all its officials. iv. The ld. Senior Counsel has also brought to the notice of the Court, the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 11th September, 2024, which again notes all the proceedings which are pending and the manner in which multiple applications, petitions, criminal complaints are being filed against the company and its officials. The observations in the said order are referred to. v. It is further submitted that the entire attempt of Mr. Pandey is to merely extort a substantial sum of money. Though, the company is willing to pay the amount as per the Arbitral award along with the interest, he is unwilling to take the same and is subjecting the company and its officials to continuous harassment in this manner. 16. Mr. Deepak Dahiya submits that he has not issued the notice and that he is not a part of CPS Legal. It is submitted that the notice was signed by Mr. Mohit Yadav, though, his name does not appear in the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submitted that from the signature, it can be deciphered that Mr. Yadav has signed the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submits that the unconditional apologies have been submitted both on behalf of himself and Mr. Mohit Yadav and the legal notice which was given has also been withdrawn. 17.

      "raw": "Court On Its Own Motion vs Roop Darshan Pandey And Ors. on 23 January, 2025 i. Mr. Pandey has abused the process of the Courts repeatedly. He has converted a contractual dispute into multiple criminal cases. ii. It is highlighted that both the matters arise out of the same contract and the same arbitration proceedings. The allegations are also similar, i.e., use of Hero MotoCorp Limited seal for attesting the true copy of documents which were belonging to Hero Honda Motors Limited, the predecessor in the interest company. The use of the said seal is stated to be only due to a name change which took place and all the allegations in the criminal complaint being filed are on the basis of the said true copy attestation. iii. Mr. Dayan Krishnan, ld. Counsel also points out that even recently another notice has been issued by Mr. Pandey on 15 th December, 2024 to the entire board of directors of HML, making allegations of forgery of the Board Resolution. In this manner, Mr. Pandey continues to harass the company as also all its officials. iv. The ld. Senior Counsel has also brought to the notice of the Court, the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 11th September, 2024, which again notes all the proceedings which are pending and the manner in which multiple applications, petitions, criminal complaints are being filed against the company and its officials. The observations in the said order are referred to. v. It is further submitted that the entire attempt of Mr. Pandey is to merely extort a substantial sum of money. Though, the company is willing to pay the amount as per the Arbitral award along with the interest, he is unwilling to take the same and is subjecting the company and its officials to continuous harassment in this manner. 16. Mr. Deepak Dahiya submits that he has not issued the notice and that he is not a part of CPS Legal. It is submitted that the notice was signed by Mr. Mohit Yadav, though, his name does not appear in the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submitted that from the signature, it can be deciphered that Mr. Yadav has signed the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submits that the unconditional apologies have been submitted both on behalf of himself and Mr. Mohit Yadav and the legal notice which was given has also been withdrawn. 17. Mr. Pandey himself submits that he has filed his affidavit and he does not wish to say anything more. He further seeks to defend the email dated 15 th December, 2024",

As regards the case of Dina Nath Misra, we find he acted in gross carelessness. Being a very experienced journalist of long standing it was his duty while publishing the news item relating to the members of the Apex Court, to have taken extra care to verify the correctness and if he had done so, we are sure there would not have been any difficulty in coming to know that the information supplied to him had absolutely no legs to stand and was patently false and the publication would have been avoided which not only caused great embarrassment to this Court but conveyed a wrong message to the public at large jeopardizing the faith of the illiterate masses in our judiciary. Shri Dina Nath Misra has no doubt committed a serious mistake but he has realised his mistake and expressed sincere repentance and has tendered unconditional apology for the same. He was present in the Court and virtually looked Court On Its Own Motion vs Roop Darshan Pandey And Ors. on 23 January, 2025 to be gloomy and felt repentant of what he had done.

    "such an absurd and mischievous interpretation of the provisions of the CrPC will not stand the test of constitutional scrutiny, and therefore cannot be adopted by us. xxx 22. Frivolous litigation should not become the order of the day in India. From misusing the public interest litigation jurisdiction of the Indian courts to abusing the criminal procedure for harassing their adversaries, the justice delivery system should not be used as a tool to fulfil personal vendetta. The Indian judiciary has taken Court On Its Own Motion vs Roop Darshan Pandey And Ors. on 23 January, 2025 cognizance of this issue. In 2014",

    "Court On Its Own Motion vs Roop Darshan Pandey And Ors. on 23 January, 2025 i. Mr. Pandey has abused the process of the Courts repeatedly. He has converted a contractual dispute into multiple criminal cases. ii. It is highlighted that both the matters arise out of the same contract and the same arbitration proceedings. The allegations are also similar, i.e., use of Hero MotoCorp Limited seal for attesting the true copy of documents which were belonging to Hero Honda Motors Limited, the predecessor in the interest company. The use of the said seal is stated to be only due to a name change which took place and all the allegations in the criminal complaint being filed are on the basis of the said true copy attestation. iii. Mr. Dayan Krishnan, ld. Counsel also points out that even recently another notice has been issued by Mr. Pandey on 15 th December, 2024 to the entire board of directors of HML, making allegations of forgery of the Board Resolution. In this manner, Mr. Pandey continues to harass the company as also all its officials. iv. The ld. Senior Counsel has also brought to the notice of the Court, the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 11th September, 2024, which again notes all the proceedings which are pending and the manner in which multiple applications, petitions, criminal complaints are being filed against the company and its officials. The observations in the said order are referred to. v. It is further submitted that the entire attempt of Mr. Pandey is to merely extort a substantial sum of money. Though, the company is willing to pay the amount as per the Arbitral award along with the interest, he is unwilling to take the same and is subjecting the company and its officials to continuous harassment in this manner. 16. Mr. Deepak Dahiya submits that he has not issued the notice and that he is not a part of CPS Legal. It is submitted that the notice was signed by Mr. Mohit Yadav, though, his name does not appear in the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submitted that from the signature, it can be deciphered that Mr. Yadav has signed the legal notice. Mr. Dahiya submits that the unconditional apologies have been submitted both on behalf of himself and Mr. Mohit Yadav and the legal notice which was given has also been withdrawn. 17. Mr. Pandey himself submits that he has filed his affidavit and he does not wish to say anything more. He further seeks to defend the email dated 15 th December, 2024",
