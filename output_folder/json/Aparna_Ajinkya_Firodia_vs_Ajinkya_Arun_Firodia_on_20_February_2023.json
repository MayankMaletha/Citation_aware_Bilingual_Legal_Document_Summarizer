This should simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful and correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut the assertions made by the respondent husband, and to establish that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If the appellant wife is right, she shall be proved to be so. 18. We would, however, while upholding the order passed by the High Court, consider it just and appropriate to record a caveat, giving the appellant wife liberty to Aparna Ajinkya Firodia vs Ajinkya Arun Firodia on 20 February, 2023",

On the contrary, if the parties have had access to each other at the relevant point of time, the fate of the question relating to legitimacy is sealed.

We are not suggesting for a moment that Section 112 acts as a shield even for the alleged adulterous conduct on the part of the wife. All that we say is that anything that would destroy the legal effect of Section 112 cannot be used by the respondent, on the ground that the same is being done to achieve another result. 24. In the case on hand, the very pleading of the respondent in his petition for divorce before the Family Court is that the second child-Master Arjun was born on 17.7.2013 and that the respondent came to know about the alleged adulterous behavior of the appellant herein, only on 14.9.2016",
