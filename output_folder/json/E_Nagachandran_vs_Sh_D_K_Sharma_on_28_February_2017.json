As per the petitioner the respondents ought to have halted the proceedings with the CVC but still went ahead without intimating the CVC or the CAT which resulted in the CVC tendering its approval to the draft chargesheet and thereafter approval of the same from the Minister. 12. In the opinion of this Court, even if the facts as alleged by the petitioner are taken to be true, no offence whatsoever is made out against the respondents. Reliance placed by the petitioner upon the orders of the CAT fixing a time limit for issuance of a chargesheet is completely misplaced. The direction issued in the order dt.25.10.2010 cannot be construed to mean that once the time limit of four weeks expired on 24.11.2010, no charge-sheet could be issued thereafter or that the disciplinary proceedings would automatically come to an end after 24.11.2010. There is no such stipulation in the said order of the CAT. Even otherwise, the time limit fixed by the CAT was not a relevant fact to be considered by the CVC or the Minister while granting their respective approvals to issue a charge-sheet to the petitioner. Hence no fault can be found with the respondents if they did not place the order of the CAT before the CVC or the Minister. E. Nagachandran vs Sh. D.K. Sharma on 28 February, 2017 13. I may also note at this stage that the petitioner had challenged his suspension order before the CAT, amongst others, on the ground of malafide. The CAT in its order dt.25.10.2010",
