the mediator. After about one month of her marriage, Babli had told him about the
demands of a motorcycle and Rs. 50,000/− as dowry, of accused Govind and his mother Kalawati,

Agnihotri Prasad on the occasion of Rakhi festival when she had confided that all the
accused persons were torturing her over non−fulfillment of their said demands. Accused Govind
had made identical demands from him by coming over one day prior to
Janamasthami and on being expressed inability by the complainant and seeking some
time, he had become angry and left the house with Babli. Thereafter as and when the complainant

disconnect it and did not allow him to talk to Babli. The Mediator Sh. Kalicharan had
telephonically informed him about suicide by Babli and that her body has been disposed
off by her husband and other in−laws. On making inquires in the neighborhood, none
claimed to know about the incident and the accused persons were found to have left
their house after locking it. He had then gone to the Police Station where his statement

Ex. PW 1/A was recorded before the Sub−Divisional Magistrate. On the next date the

Ex. PW 1/D and Ex. PW 1/E. Govind had made detailed disclosure statement Ex. PW
1/F to the effect that he had cut the rope with which Babli had hanged, with a kitchen
knife and got her down. She was gasping at that time and apprehending that she will
implicate all his family members in the case, he had strangulated her by pressing her
neck/throat with both hands till she died. Pursuant to his statement he had got recovered rope and
kitchen knife and bed−sheet from miyani under the staircase, which were
seized vide memos Ex. PW 1/G and Ex. PW 1/H. He had also pointed out the broken

Police in his presence. On being cross−examined by Ld. Addl. PP, the witness took
somersault to the extent of disowning his statement Ex. PW 1/A. In his re−examination,
the witness claimed that he had made statement on 20.08.2010 under the influence and
pressure of Police.

Raju and mother had then gone to her matrimonial home and was informed of the same
reason of her non−availability. He claimed that his sister was living happily. He also contended
that police had obtained his signatures on blank papers. During cross−
examination by Ld. Addl. PP, the witness disowned material parts of his statement Ex.

22/A. His personal search was conducted vide memo Ex. PW 22/B and his disclosure statement
Ex. PW 22/C was recorded. The evidence of prosecution was closed on 05.07.2016.

24. In their statements separately recorded under Sec. 313 Cr.PC, accused
persons claimed to be innocent and falsely implicated in this case. They denied having
committed the offence as alleged by Police in this case. Nothing was recovered at their
instance. The alleged recovery has been planted by IO on the basis of mere suspicion.
No demand was ever made by her in−laws from Babli at any point of time. It was also
stated that Kalicharan was not mediator in the marriage. They declined to lead evidence in defence.

25. I have heard Sh. P. K. Samadhiya, Ld. Addl. PP for the State, Sh.
Rakesh Patiyal, Advocate, Ld. Defence counsel and carefully perused the file. Faced
SC No. 92/01/14 FIR No. 485/09 P.S. Jahangirpuri State Vs. Govind & Ors. Page No. 12 of 25
with the uphill task of retrieving the prosecution case against severe odds where 7 out of
8 cited public witnesses have turned hostile from the word 'go' and complainant seemed
to initially support his complaint yet turned turtle, on being recalled just after three days
of deferring his examination−in−chief on 20.08.2010 on his own request of not feeling
well after getting recorded six pages of his examination, Ld. Addl. PP has cited 'Khujji
@ Surendra Tiwari V. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1991 SC 1853' to contend that the testimony
o f h o s t i l e w i t n e s s c a n n o t b e t o t a l l y e f f a c e d b u t t h e p o r t i o n s f i n d i n g
support from other evidence can be relied upon. According to him PW 1 has not only
deposed about the demands raised by accused Govind and his family members for Rs. 50,000/−
and a motorcycle through deceased Babli but also directly from him. The
deceased had further confided in him that she is being tortured by her husband and in−
laws due to non−fulfillment of their said demands. The conduct of accused persons in
not permitting the deceased to talk to the complainant and his brother over telephone
indicated their disgruntled and hostile behaviour. The deceased, all of about 21 years
may not have been able to bear such harassment and was therefore led to end her life by hanging in
her first floor room of the house of accused Ram Naresh. It has been
contended that recovery of dead body is not sine qua non for proceeding with murder
case and even proving unnatural death.

in vital aspects. The witness was also re−examined by Ld. Addl. PP in which he further

State vs . 1. Govind on 21 February, 2017

strangulated the prosecution story. There can be no element of manipulation by the
accused persons as at that time they were in judicial custody and therefore could not
have approached him. PW 2, Kalicharan, PW 3 Agnihotri Prasad, phupha and brother
of complainant and deceased respectively have demolished the case of prosecution and
supported the defence. Both of them along with complainant had made endeavour to
search for missing Babli about which they were informed in the evening of 21.08.2009.
The brothers along with accused Govind had even gone to the Police Station for lodging
her missing report but were asked to search for her on their own for some more time.
Neither the accused persons nor the family of complainant was in a position to take
cudgels with Police nor were they so educated or well off to take any professional help
to guard against consequences. PW 4 Smt. Dimple, PW 5 Smt. Gudiya, PW 8 Richhpal, PW−

any foothold to the prosecution. Sh. Patiyal has also pointed out glaring discrepancies in
the investigation conducted by Police on 28.08.2009 and 09.09.2009 by referring to the
statements of PW 9 HC Dharambir, PW 17 IO/Insp. Raj Kumar and PW 21 SI Ramesh
Kumar. He has thus urged this court to hold that the prosecution has utterly failed to
prove the charges against the accused persons.

SC No. 92/01/14 FIR No. 485/09 P.S. Jahangirpuri State Vs. Govind & Ors. Page No. 14 of 25

27. By this time, more than seven years have passed to the mysterious
disappearance of Babli and the parties to this case do not claim to have heard about her during this

been made to justify the terminology 'deceased' for Babli in these presents.

also identified the accused persons but denied knowledge about this case. He claimed
that Police has just asked him the whereabouts of his cousin Sanjay and were informed
that Sanjay has gone to his native place. All these witnesses have alleged that Police had
obtained their signatures of blank papers on false pretext by assuring that they will not
be called anywhere. Even the complainant/PW−1 confirms that he had inquired from the
neighbours of accused persons about the incident but they had pleaded ignorance about his sister.

Rs. 50,000/− and a motorcycle, after about one month of marriage and again when she was
brought to her maternal home by PW 3 on the occasion of Rakhi festival
(05.08.2009). On the second occasion, she had supplemented it by saying that her in−
laws were mentally torturing her. Accused Govind is claimed to have himself made the

very same demands to PW 1, one day prior to Janmashtami (i.e. on 13.08.2009) and on
being expressed inability by the complainant, he had left with his wife Babli in a huff. It
has been alleged that thereafter the accused persons did not permit Babli to talk to the
complainant or his family members.

alleged demands within three months appear to be unnatural unless the in−laws of Babli
had been assured that the demanded items will be provided in short time, which does not
appear to be the case. No call details or even the phone numbers of parties have been
collected to show the frequency and duration of calls between the two sides to assess that relations

complainant on 13.08.2009. It would be exaggerated to assume that just because Babli
was not allowed to talk to the complainant and his family members whenever they made
a call at her house, she was harassed or treated with cruelty. The complainant apparently
did not ask his sister as to how she was being mentally tortured and therefore could not
elaborate that aspect. Since Babli was married to accused Govind only about three and
half months prior to the alleged date of incident even if, it is taken that subjecting her to cruelty or
harassment by her husband and in−laws was 'soon before her death', the
gravity of her treatment at matrimonial home and that too in connection with demand
for dowry need to be convincingly established. It has been held in 'Savitri Devi V. Ramesh Chand,

family. It was held that such utterances hurt the feelings but do not amount to cruelty
u/s.498A IPC. Prosecution against the accused persons except the husband was thus quashed.

marriage, now somebody must be held culprit and the noose must be made to fit some
neck. Going further, it was observed that in order to convict a person for abetment of suicide, apart

woman had committed suicide on account of cruelty or harassment meted out to her by
the appellants in connection with the demand of dowry.

and when Babli was subjected to cruelty on non−fulfillment of demands for dowry by
the accused persons or any of them. The judgment in 'Surender Kumar @ Khujji' is not
squarely applicable to the facts in hand as PW−1 Raju did not take somersault because of
the machination of accused persons as all the four male accused persons were in judicial
custody at that time since the day of their arrest in this case. He may have so done either
on hearing his inner voice after making discrete personal inquiries in the locality where
matrimonial home of Babli was situated. The family of complainant may also have
taken some sort of decision about this case as his relatives PW 2 and PW 3 examined a
few weeks after him did not support the prosecution at all.

examination on behalf of the state. PW−3 however was suggested that PW 2 Kalicharan
had told him about body of Babli having been secretly cremated. No evidence was
collected during investigation from the cremation ground situated in the vicinity, to rule
out such a probability. It appears that except following the laid down procedure in cases
of missing persons/bodies, in a lackadaisical manner, of flashing an All India Message
with photo of Babli and giving of 'hue and cry' notice just amounted to lip service. No
extra efforts were made by investigating officer as the situation demanded. Even if, it

Authorities. The police rather had directed the complainant himself to make inquiries
from the nearby Police Stations about recovery of any missing person or body by taking
her photograph.

meticulously dispose off a dead body leaving absolutely no trace behind and at such a

maneuvering and shrewed, they would not have left the pieces of rope etc. at the spot
which the Police has easily found lying.

incident by locking their house. Had this been the case, the IO needed to explain as to
from where he could procure the keys of house of accused persons on 28.08.2009 after
registration of FIR on 27.08.2009 as there is no indication of door of said house being broken by

through a duplicate key. The IO also needed to question the accused persons about their
destination, which should have been verified and relevant witnesses cited. The three
material witnesses PW 9, PW 17 and PW 21 have made varying statements in material particulars
when they were together in investigation on 28.08.2009 and again on 09.09.2009.

prepared by the IO doubtful. PW 9 claimed that the house of accused Ram Naresh had
been pointed out by a public person. PW 21 contended that they had reached the house
themselves on the basis of address available with them. IO/PW 17 contended that it was
identified by PW 1 Raju. PW 17 & PW 21 denied that any public person/neighbour had
entered into the house with them except of course the complainant but PW 9 stated that
public person had gone inside the room on the first floor with PW 17 and PW 21. The
three witnesses are also divergent about having visited the second floor of the property
on that day and the presence of tenant in said portion. It is strange that despite remaining
at the spot for about three hours, the police personnel could only seize red colour wire,
rope and bed−sheet on 28.08.2009, which were all before their eyes in the room of Babli.
Why the articles kept in miyani adjacent to the staircase were not searched on that day,
SC No. 92/01/14 FIR No. 485/09 P.S. Jahangirpuri State Vs. Govind & Ors. Page No. 22 of 25
find no logical explanation. The second bed−sheet and other part of rope allegedly got recovered
from the said miyani purportedly at the instance of accused Govind on
09.09.2009 does not inspire confidence. The senior police officials could not have spent
so much of time in investigating a small room from where they could hardly collect any
clinching evidence. It is an irony that PW 7 Ms. Paraveen Singh Dhama, Executive
Magistrate did not even think it fit to visit the spot once for self assessment. The casual
manner in which this case has been taken up since beginning is clear from the fact that
the complainant along with his mother had reported the matter to PW 7 on 25.08.2009.
Instead of recording their statements, she passed an order on 26.08.2009 the basis of
their verbal complaint, for registration of case by the concerned SHO. The FIR was
registered in pursuance of said order on 27.08.2009 and the investigation commenced on
28.08.2009. Ironically the Police team including the IO did not inspect the beam in the
room with which the deceased had reportedly tied the rope for hanging herself, to gauze
whether the dust that normally gets accumulated at inaccessible places in the houses
over period of time, was removed by the use of such rope. The incident having taken
place in August 2009, it must have been quite humid but the pieces of rope Ex. P−4 and Ex. P−
6 recovered from the spot were not sent for testing the presence of human sweat on them.

Policemen were in uniform. The three witnesses also claimed that complainant/PW 1
had joined them to identify the accused persons about whom secret information had

been received but the complainant denied this fact. No efforts were subsequently made
to search the carpenter, who was employed by accused Ram Naresh for changing the
door of first floor room of his house. Even the photographs of the new/repaired door
have not been taken. No attempt has been made to show that the broken pieces of wood in Ex. P−

offences could be brought on record by the prosecution. PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 have
spoken about Babli suffering from some disease since her childhood due to which she used to
forget way back to her home on some occasions and therefore had to be
searched for. No medical documents for the treatment allegedly administered to him for
said disease although have been proved yet the cohesive statements of three witnesses
closely related to Babli, cannot be shirked. These witnesses also claimed that accused Govind had
informed them about Babli having not returned from the market after purchasing
