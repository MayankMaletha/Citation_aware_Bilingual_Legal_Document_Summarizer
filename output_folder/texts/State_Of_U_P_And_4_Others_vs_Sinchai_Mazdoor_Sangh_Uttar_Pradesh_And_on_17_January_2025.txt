(Per : Hon'ble Jayant Banerji, J.) Special Appeal No. 232 of 2021

1. Against the judgment dated 14.1.2020 passed by a learned Judge in Writ-A No.12780 of 2018, the
State authorities have filed this special appeal.

2. By means of the judgment under appeal, after considering the facts of the case and various
judgments, the learned Judge observed that the case of petitioners-respondents is on a much better
footing than those petitioners who had approached the Supreme Court in Prem Singh vs. State of
U.P. & Ors.1, and that their service is required to be considered for computation of length of services
for extending pensionary benefits to them from the State Government as the petitioners were
appointed on substantive posts in regular capacity and had rendered continuous service and the
State Government also accorded regular pay scale and other allowances admissible to similarly
situated other government employees. It was held that in such a situation, after their retirement, it
could not be accepted that the services of petitioners would be governed under the Labour Laws
disentitling them for pensionary benefits at par with State Government employees. Accordingly, the
order impugned dated 7.3.2018 passed by the Principal Secretary, State of U.P., Lucknow, was set
aside as being unsustainable and the writ petition was allowed. It was held that the petitioners are
entitled for pension and other benefits as admissible to similarly situated employees of the State
Government from the date of their superannuation.

3. The contention of the learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the appellants is that
the petitioner-respondents had throughout submitted to the certified Standing Orders framed under
the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 19462, which applies to private bodies and
Government. It is contended that their conditions of service were governed by the Standing Orders

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

Act and they would be entitled to pension only in accordance with the Employees Pension Scheme,
1995 which employees other than the petitioners, who are similarly situated, are getting. Learned
counsel has referred to the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department (Irrigation Workshop Circle
Kanpur) Semi Technical Service Rules, 19843. It is stated that the petitioners were working since
prior to 1984 when the Rules, 1984 came into force; that the conditions of service of the petitioners
were governed in terms of the Certified Standing Orders and they cannot be stated to be appointed
to a civil post or a civil service under the State Government so as to entitle them for pension which is
earned by service in the Civil Department as required under the Civil Service Regulations; that
retirement benefits including pension are covered under the U.P. Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961
including consistent provisions of the Civil Service Regulations, which are applicable only to officials
under the rules making power of the Governor or those appointed to civil service or holding a civil
post under the State Government. The petitioners being workmen appointed under the Certified
Standing Orders would not be entitled for pension benefits under the Rules, 1961. It is stated that
the Certified Standing Orders have been framed under the aforesaid Act, 1946, which is a special law
governing the class of workmen to which the petitioners belong; that to avail the benefit of pension
under the provisions of Employees Pension Scheme, 19954, prescribed documents with signatures
were required to be submitted by the petitioners after retirement but majority of them have not
done so and are claiming pension as admissible to regular employees which is not admissible in law;
that during service the petitioners were contributing to the provident fund under the Employees'
Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 19525; that the petitioners being workmen in the
Workshop Division of the Irrigation Department were covered under the EPF Act and as per the
Pension Scheme, their contribution in this regard was specified and being paid; the petitioners
being workmen have to avail their remedy before the Industrial Forum created under the U.P.
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and not in writ jurisdiction before this Court. In support of his
contentions, learned counsel has referred to various judgments of this Court as well as of the
Supreme Court as under:-

(i) A judgment of a single Judge in Moti Lal Kushwaha vs. State of U.P. & Ors.6

(ii) A judgment of a division bench in an intra-court appeal in Moti Lal Kushwaha vs.
State of U.P. & Ors.7

(iii) Bramhadeen & Ors. vs. State of U.P. & Ors.8

(iv) Ved Prakash Saxena vs. State of U.P. & 4 Ors.9

(v) A.B. Krishna vs. State of Karnataka10

(vi) D.R. Yadav vs. R.K. Singh11

4. Learned counsel for the petitioner-respondents has submitted that the terms and conditions of
the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 are governed by the Rules, 1984, which have been made for
regulating the recruitment and service conditions of the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 and are
applicable to them in view of the fact that they have been appointed prior to coming into force of the

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

Rules, 1984. It is stated that the posts specified in Appendix-A of the Rules, 1984 contains all the
posts sanctioned under the Irrigation Workshop Circle Kanpur and the same is applicable to the
petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17. It is stated that in view of these special rules enacted, the Certified
Standing Orders framed under the Standing Orders Act would not apply. It is stated that in view of
the provision of Rule 25 of the Rules, 1984, which has been interpreted by a coordinate Bench of this
Court in the case of State of U.P. & Ors. vs. Om Prakash12, the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17
continue to be governed by Rules, 1984; that the Certified Standing Orders cannot govern the
conditions of service of the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 in view of the special provisions in the
Rules, 1984.

5. It is stated that the judgment of Moti Lal Kushwaha (supra), which has been relied upon by the
appellants would have no bearing on the present case inasmuch as the Rules, 1984 were not
considered therein; that in the Government Orders of 13.11.2007 and 27.2.2009, the State
Government had admitted that the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 were government servants and
entitled to dearness allowance and time scale as applicable to regular government servants. Learned
counsel has referred to various letters issued by the Senior Officers of the Irrigation Department to
the State Government for payment of pension and other benefits admissible to regular government
servants working in the Department to the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17. It is stated that the
Standing Orders Act acknowledges in the definition of an 'employer' in any industrial establishment,
as the head of the Department appointed by the Government. In such a situation, the
petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 would come under the purview of Regulation 361 of the Civil
Service Regulation entitling them for pension. It is stated that classifying the petitioner-respondent
nos.2 to 17 as workmen of Industrial Establishment is an artificial classification as they have been
working against substantive posts since the beginning and their appointments were duly made. It is
stated that the Pension Scheme was brought into force in the year 1995, whereas the
petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 were working since a very long time. They have retired after
completing nearly 35 yeas of service and have been denied pensionary benefit from the State
Government.

It is stated that earlier, the Roorkee Workshop, which is now in Uttarakhand State, employed
similarly circumstanced employees as the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 and they are being paid
regular pension by the State Government of Uttarakhand which followed the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Prem Singh (supra) and issued a Government Order in this regard on
1.8.2020. In support of his contentions, learned counsel has relied upon a judgment of a coordinate
Bench of this Court in the case of Om Prakash (supra), State of U.P. & Ors. vs. Gorakh Nath Pandey
& Ors.13, as well as the judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases of Prem Singh (supra), and
Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. vs. Chief Inspector of Factories & Ors.14.

6. A series of supplementary affidavits and affidavits have been filed on behalf of the appellants. In
the supplementary affidavit dated 22.7.2021, enclosed therewith, in response to a letter submitted
by Works Manager of the Irrigation Workshop Division, Meerut dated 22.2.2021, is a letter dated
23.2.2021 in which it is reflected that each of the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 had withdrawn
their provident fund dues from the Employees Provident Fund Organisation. It further appears that
by a letter dated 1.3.2021 from the Employees Provident Fund Organisation, two of the aforesaid

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

petitioner-respondents, namely Gordhan Singh and Laxmi Chand, had opted for pension under the
provisions of the Pension Scheme after submitting Form 10-D. It is stated that the remaining
petitioner-respondents are also equally placed alongwith the above two workmen, namely Gordhan
Singh and Laxmi Chand, and they are also entitled to withdrawn their pension as per the Pension
Scheme after submitting Form 10-D.

7. A supplementary affidavit dated 22.9.2021 was then filed enclosing therewith a certificate of
Standing Orders in Form-B dated 28.9.1970 issued under the Standing Orders Act bearing
No.678(1) of 1970. The name of the Industrial Establishment specified therein is M/s. Irrigation
Workshop Division, Mawana Road, Meerut. The aforesaid certificate appears to be granted pursuant
to the approval of proposed modifications (with some alteration) in the existing Certified Standing
Orders of that Industrial Establishment.

Also brought on record is an office order dated 17.11.1972 issued by the Executive Engineer,
Irrigation Meerut appointing one of the petitioner-respondents, i.e., Sarjeet Singh as a daily wager
for a period of three months on a temporary post.

8. It is stated in this supplementary affidavit that the service of the employees of the Industrial
Workshop is different than the service conditions of regular workmen of the Department of
Irrigation. The former set of employees' service condition is covered by the Standing Orders Act. It is
further stated that under the EPF Act, the scheme framed thereunder is made applicable to all the
factories and establishment to which the EPF Act applies. The Pension Scheme was made by the
Central Government which provided the applicability of the Pension Scheme to all the employees of
factories and other establishments to which the EPF Act applies. It is stated that the Pension
Scheme is applicable to the petitioner-respondents and contribution thereof was regularly being
made by the petitioner-respondents, as follows:-

"a. Employees Contribution - 12% (Basic) Pay + DA) b. Employer Contribution - 12%
(Basic) Pay + DA) c. Total Contribution - 24% d. Payment on Retirement - 15.67%
(along with accumulated interest) e. Rest as pension - 8.33%"

9. It has been stated that the aforesaid payment has also been made to the petitioner-respondents
and they are also being paid pension as per the Pension Scheme (sic-two petitioners). It is,
therefore, stated that the petitioner-respondents cannot claim benefit of dual pension.

A copy of the license in Form-3 under Section 6 of the Factories Act granted to the Superintending
Engineer, Irrigation Workshop of Kanpur Circle by the Labour Department, Uttar Pradesh on
5.11.2019 has been enclosed. In the description of the licensed premises, it is mentioned that the
licensed premises are situated at Irrigation Workshop Division, Mawana Road, District Meerut and
consists of the building shown on the approved site plan.

10. An affidavit dated 18.10.2021 was filed in compliance of the order dated 6.10.2021 passed by this
Court, which order reads as follows:-

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

"During the course of arguments, one of the submissions that has come from the
learned counsel for the appellants is that the U.P. Irrigation Department (Irrigation
Workshop Circle, Kanpur) Semi Technical Service Rules, 1984 ipso facto will not be
applicable to the writ petitioners as from the description of the Department, in which
they were employed, it appears that they were either located in Irrigation Workshop
at Meerut or Okhla Irrigation Workshop.

The learned counsel for the writ petitioners, in his compilation of papers, has brought
on record an office memorandum dated 01.01.1990 issued from the office of
Pramukh Abhiyanta, Sajja Evam Samagri Prabandh, Sinchai Vibhag, Uttar Pradesh
which discloses that Irrigation Workshop Circle Kanpur includes the Irrigation
Workshops of Roorki, Bareilly, Meerut, Jhansi and Kanpur.

Further, from the averment made in paragraph 21 of the writ petition, it appears that
the writ-petitioners had set up a claim that the terms and conditions of the services of
the petitioners are governed by Sinchai Karyashala Circle Service Rules, 1984 of
which the reply in the counter affidavit is provided in paragraph 16 wherein, though,
the appellants have claimed that the service conditions of the petitioners are
governed under the provisions of Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 but there is no
specific statement that the 1984 Rules would not be applicable because they were
employed either at Mawana in Meerut or at Okhla. However, in addition to above, in
paragraph 16, it is also stated that the provisions of Sinchai Karyashala Circle Service
Rules, 1984 have been implemented upon the regular technical employees in regular
Establishment.

Under the circumstances, as there is no specific stand coming from the appellants
with regard to the area of operation of the 1984 Rules, we deem it appropriate to
require the appellants to file an affidavit stating specifically whether the area of
operation of Sinchai Karyashala Circle Service Rules 1984 is limited to Kanpur Circle.
If it is limited to Kanpur Circle, then they shall also specifically disclose as to what is
the area of operation of Kanpur Circle and, in all, how many Circles are there in the
State of U.P. and what is the area of each Circle and whether the Irrigation
Workshops at Roorki, Bareilly, Meerut, Jhansi and Kanpur fall in the same Circle or
different Circles, and the name of those Circles shall also be disclosed.

Affidavit, as above, be filed within two weeks.

Put up for further hearing on 25.10.2021 at 2:00 pm."

11. It has been stated in this affidavit that after the completion of Workshops in Okhla Barrage in the
year 1983-84, some of the surplus workmen from Erection Division, Okhla were adjusted in
industrial establishment of Irrigation Workshop Division, Mawana Road, Meerut. One of the
petitioner-respondents, namely Satveer Singh, was so adjusted; that prior to 1974, the workmen of
industrial establishment were paid daily wages and from 01.01.1974 they were provided post

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

and'pay-scale'.

12. It is further stated in the affidavit that the aforesaid Rules, 1984 are not applicable to the
petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17. The Rules, 1984 are applicable to 97 regular posts whereas in the
year 1976 there were 927 sanctioned posts of industrial workmen in the Workshop Divisions. A true
copy of office order dated 21.1.1976 issued by the Chief Engineer has been enclosed which reads as
follows:-

13. It has been stated that due to technical advances and to facilitate the works in the irrigation
workshops, it was decided to recruit regular employees with technical education and to regulate
their service conditions, the Rules, 1984 were framed. Those employees, who were covered under
the Rules, 1984, were extended the benefit of Fundamental Rules, Ancillary Rules and Civil Services
Regulation Rules. It has further been stated that the petitioner-respondents, who were industrial
workmen working in the Irrigation Workshop, Meerut under the provisions of the Standing Orders
A c t w e r e n o t c o v e r e d b y t h e p r o v i s i o n s o f t h e R u l e s , 1 9 8 4 . I t h a s b e e n s t a t e d t h a t
petitioner-respondents were all appointed prior to 1984 and it has been indicated with reference to a
p r o c e e d i n g u n d e r S e c t i o n 3 3 - C ( 2 ) o f t h e I n d u s t r i a l D i s p u t e s A c t , 1 9 4 7 t h a t t h e
petitioner-respondents were resorting to the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 for
redressal of their grievance.

14. It is stated that prior to 1994, the Irrigation Workshop Circle, Kanpur had the administrative
control of workshops at Roorkee, Bareilly, Meerut, Jhansi and Kanpur and thus the
petitioner-respondents were industrial workmen in the industrial workshop of the Irrigation
Department in Workshop Division, Meerut which was registered under the Factories Act. It is
further stated that this administrative mechanism continued till 1994 whereafter the Irrigation
Workshop Circle-2 Bahraich was created which was later converted to Irrigation Workshop Circle,
Lucknow in 1996. Thereafter, the Roorkee Workshop was shifted to Uttaranchal. It is further stated
that as on date, there are two circles:- one is the Irrigation Workshop-Kanpur which has under its
administrative control, the workshops at Jhansi and Bareilly, and, the second is the Irrigation
Workshop Lucknow, which has under its administrative control Workshops at Kanpur, Meerut,
Allahabad and Gorakhpur.

15. In paragraph 13 of the affidavit, it is stated that the Irrigation Workshop Circle, Kanpur has
under its administrative control workshops at Bareilly, which has 361 sanctioned posts and
Irrigation Workshop Jhansi, which has 171 posts. Similarly, the Irrigation Workshop CircleLucknow has under its administrative control, Irrigation Workshop, Meerut (Sanctioned post-258),
Irrigation Workshop Kanpur (Sanctioned posts- 100), Irrigation Workshop Allahabad-(Sanctioned
posts-62) and Irrigation Workshop Gorakhpur-(Sanctioned Posts-126). The combined sanctioned
posts of both the Circles consist of 1078 workmen in the Industrial Establishment, whereas the
Rules of 1984 were applicable to 97 regular post only.

16. Thereafter, a supplementary affidavit was filed on 11.1.2022 on behalf of the appellant-State. As
it appears from paragraph no.4 of this supplementary affidavit, the affidavit was filed to submit that
the petitioner-respondents were not covered by the Rules, 1984, and, further, to submit that for
what purpose and for whom the Rules, 1984 were made.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

17. It has been stated that the Rules, 1984 have been framed for the employees of the regular
establishment working in the workshops of Kanpur Circle (primarily at the workshops of Jhansi and
Bareilly where a few permanent employees were working whose services were governed by the
Fundamental Rules). These permanent workers were distinct and constituted a separate cadre from
the industrial workmen working in the Workshops of Kanpur Circle as their services were not
governed by the certified Standing Orders framed under the Standing Orders Act and the Rules,
1946. As such, for purposes of regulating the service of such permanent workmen, the Rules, 1984
have been framed and were specifically applicable only for such existing posts (97 posts
available/sanctioned at Jhansi and Bareilly Workshops only). Paragraph nos.7 to 10 of the aforesaid
supplementary affidavit reads as follows:-

"7. That further in pursuance of the order dated 06.10.2021 to the query of the
Hon'ble Court regarding of area of operation of Kanpur Circle and other related
query as stated above in para 3 of the affidavit, it is submitted that initially all the
workshops i.e. Roorki, Meerut, Bareilly, Jhansi, Kanpur, Allahabad and Gorakhpur
were under the Kanpur Circle which was the only circle for whole State of U.P.. At
later stage by the office memorandum dated 26.04.1994 the bifurcation/work
allocation between the different workshops as stated above was done. By the
aforesaid office memorandum dated 26.04.1994 the Kanpur Circle was bifurcated in
two circles i.e. Sinchai Karyashal Mandal-I, Kanpur and Sinchal Karyashala
Mandal-II Bahraich.

memorandum dated 26.04.1994 and the Government Order dated 02.08.1996 are

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

being filed herewith and marked as Annexure No.SA-1 and SA-2 to this affidavit.

8. That it is relevant to mention here that so far as the applicability of the Rules, 1984
is concerned, it is relevant to mention here that as stated above the Rules, 1984 were
specifically created for the permanent workmen working in the workshops of Jhansi
and Bareilly, Kanpur Circle, Kanpur upon whom the certified Standing Orders were
not applicable as per Section 13B of the Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act,
1946. The reason for employment of such workmen only in the aforesaid two
workshops was that Hydro Mechanical Works (Work of Precision which required
technical qualifications) were being done only in the workshops of Jhansi and
Bareilly as such to regulate the service conditions of aforesaid such workmen the
Rules, 1984 have been promulgated. True copy of the Certified Standing Order of
Irrigation Workshop, Jhansi and Irrigation Workshop, Meerut are being annexed
herewith and marked as Annexure No.SA-3 and SA-4 to this affidavit.

9. That as such in view of the facts and circumstances stated as above, it becomes
quite clear that the purpose of promulgation of Rules, 1984 was only to regulate the
service conditions of those employees specifically working in the Jhansi and Barellly
workshops of Kanpur Circle whose service conditions were not governed by the
certified standing orders issued by the State of U.P. i.e. employees whose service
conditions were governed as per Section 13B of the Industrial Employment (Standing
Orders) Act, 1946.

10. That the Respondent-Petitioner who were employed in Irrigation Workshop
Division, Meerut are specifically governed by the Certified Standing Order issued for
Irrigation Workshop, Meerut (Annexure No.SA-4). It is relevant to mention here that
the service conditions of the respondents were at no point of time either before or
after the promulgation of Rules, 1984 were governed by the aforesaid Rules. It is
further submitted that the respondents who have retired from the Irrigation
Workshop Division, Meerut are such workmen who do not belong to the category of
the employee as mentioned in Section 13B of the Industrial Employment (Standing
Orders) Act, 1946 as such at no point of time it can be said that the workmen
belonging to the category of the employees of regular establishment and can be said
to be equivalent to the employees of the Department of Irrigation, State of U.P."

18. Thus the affidavit of 18.10.2021 and the supplementary affidavit of 11.01.2022 filed by the
appellants seek to demonstrate that the concerned workshops were initially under administrative
control of the Kanpur Circle. After 1994, two Circles were created having administrative control over
various workshops. The stand is that the Rules, 1984 have been framed for the employees of the
regular establishment working in the workshops of Kanpur Circle (primarily at workshop of Jhansi
and Bareilly where few permanent employees were working whose services were governed by the
Fundamental Rules of the Government); that these permanent workers are distinct and constituted
a separate cadre from the industrial workmen working in the Workshops of Kanpur Circle as their
services were not governed by the certified Standing Orders framed under the Standing Orders Act

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

and the Rules, 1946; that, as such, for purposes of regulating the service of such permanent
workmen, the Rules, 1984 have been framed and were specifically applicable only for such existing
97 posts available/sanctioned at Jhansi and Bareilly Workshops only.

It needs mention that the Rules, 1984 in its long title as well as in its preamble refer to the Irrigation
Workshop Circle Kanpur.

19. It is pertinent to mention that no response/reply has been filed by the petitioner-respondents to
any of the aforesaid four supplementary affidavits/affidavits filed on behalf of the appellants.

20. There is yet another un-rebutted supplementary affidavit dated 22.11.2022 filed on behalf of the
appellant-State in which it is stated as follows:-

"3. That the petitioners were industrial workmen and performed their duties in the

5. That the Irrigation workshop Division, Meerut was established, which is an
Industrial Establishment working under the Department of Irrigation functioning

established workshops was done on daily wage basis in different trades thereafter
from 01.01.1974 the workmen employed on daily wage basis against different trade
were sanctioned different scales of pay. It is further submitted that their services
conditions were governed by the Standing Orders made in pursuance of the
Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 which is different from the
employees engaged on work charge basis working in the regular establishment of the
Department of Irrigation.

6. That the services of the employees of the Industrial Workshop is different from the
service conditions of the employee working in regular establishment of the

referred as "Standing Orders, 1991").

8. That to understand the provisions governing the services of the workmen
employed in different workshops of the Irrigation Department established in the
State of Uttar Pradesh it would be important to understand the past and present
structure of the workshop created under various, Circles in the State of Uttar Pradesh
which is as follows:-"

Judge in the case of Ramakant Yadav15, which has been referred to in the aforesaid supplementary
affidavit dated 22.11.2022 in paragraphs 12 to 15 thereof, reads as follows:-

"Leaned counsel for the petitioner states that the relief is not very happily worded
and as such he may be permitted to amend the relief, during the course of the day.

Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Rajendra Prasad Dubey, learned
Additional Chief Standing Counsel for the State-respondents.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

The present petition has been filed alleging that the petitioner was engaged at the
Irrigation Department as a labour and received salary from 7.11.1982 up to 30th
November, 1984, however the petitioner was stopped from performing his services.
As the petitioner was not permitted to continue, the petitioner approached the
Labour Court by filing Case No. 298 of 1985, which was decided vide order dated
9.1.1989 (Annexure-2 to the writ petition), whereby the Labour Court held that the
removal of the petitioner on 7.11.1984 was not a valid removal and directions were
passed for reinstatement of the petitioner with back wages.

In terms of the said order, the petitioner was re-engaged in service and he continued
to work on the post in terms of the said order. It is argued that from 1989, the
petitioner was asked to provide to work as a helper in place of Chowkidar, which the
petitioner did and continue to do so till 1.1.996.

The petitioner alleges that all the persons similarly situated as the petitioner were
regularized in the department in December, 1996 (Anneuxre-3 to the petition),
however, the case of the petitioner was not considered. The petitioner was not being
paid salary of helper, as such, the petitioner again approached the Labour Court. The
claim of the petitioner before the Labour Court was that he was being asked to work
as a helper, whereas he was being paid as Chowkidar. Thus, the claim was that
difference of the salary should be paid to the petitioner.

In the said proceedings, a reply was filed by the respondents accepting that the
petitioner continue to work as a helper, however, on 29.12.2014, an order has been
passed, which is also reflected in the service book of the petitioner to show that the
petitioner shall now work on the post as he was working prior to 1.1.996 on the post
of Chowkidar.

The claim of the petitioner is that the petitioner should be paid the difference of
salary for the period, on which the work of helper was taken from the petitioner and
he is entitled to regularization in view of the fact that all persons similarly placed
were regularized way back in 1996. The fact is that the petitioner still continues to
work as Chowkidar and regularization benefits has not been accorded to the
petitioner.

The first relief of the petitioner for payment of difference of wages on account of the
fact that petitioner had worked as a helper is liable to be rejected on the ground that
the petitioner had agitated the same before the Industrial Court in Case No. 10 of
2015. As such, the same cannot be re-agitated in the present proceedings.

The second claim of the petitioner for regularization merits acceptance, as admitted,
the petitioner has worked since 1982 and all the persons similar to the petitioner
have been regularized, thus the writ petition is allowed insofar as the relief of the
regularization is claimed. The respondents are directed to regularize the services of

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

the petitioner within a period of three months from today and pass necessary orders
in respect whereof as has been done in the case of similarly placed employees.

The said relief to the petitioner is also liable to be allowed in view of the judgment of
the Supreme Court in the case Secretary, State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi (3), (2006)
4 SCC 1.

The writ petition stands allowed in terms of the said order.

Copy of the order downloaded from the official website of this Court shall be treated
as certified copy of this order."

23. The aforesaid judgment of the learned Single Judge was challenged by the State in Special
Appeal No.66 of 2022 before this Court, which was allowed by means of the following judgment
dated 9.2.2022 :-

" H e a r d S r i P . K . G a n g u l i , l e a r n e d S t a n d i n g C o u n s e l f o r t h e
appellant/State-respondents and Sri Sunil Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the
petitioner-respondent.

This Special Appeal has been filed by the State-appellants praying to set aside the
impugned judgement dated 1.10.2021, passed by learned Single Judge in Writ-A No.
19152 of 2019 (Ramakant Yadav Vs. State of U.P. and 3 others).

Perusal of the writ petition shows that there is no whisper in the pleadings which may
indicate either claim of the petitioner-respondent for regularization or any rules or
scheme providing for regularization.

It is well settled that services of a daily wager, adhoc or temporary can be regularized
only as per the rules or scheme for regularization. Neither there is whisper in the
entire writ petition nor in the impugned judgement about any rules or scheme for
regularization, under which the petitioner-respondent could be regularized.

Under the circumstances, the impugned judgement of learned Single Judge cannot be
sustained and is hereby set aside.

The Special Appeal is allowed."

.

24. Thereafter, in the SLP (C) No.6550 of 2022, the Supreme Court, while granting leave to the
petitioner therein, Ramakant Yadav, allowed the civil appeal by the following judgment dated
22.7.2022 :-

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

"Leave granted.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned Judgment and order dated
09.02.2022 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Special Appeal
No. 66 of 2022, by which the Division Bench of the High Court has allowed the said
Special Appeal preferred by the State of U.P. and set aside the judgment and order
passed by learned Single Judge directing the State to regularise the services of the
appellant, the original writ petitioner has preferred the present appeal.

In response to the notice issued by this Court, Shri Ravindra Raizada, AAG/learned
Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the State of U.P. He has stated at the Bar
and even so stated in the counter affidavit that in fact the appellant has been treated
as a permanent employee in the industrial establishment after completion of
requisite period and even thereafter he has been even granted three ACPs. In that
view of the matter, we set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the
Division Bench of the High Court. The appellant be treated as a permanent employee
in Industrial Establishment at Gorakhpur and necessary consequences shall follow.

The present Appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent. No costs.

25. It is pertinent to look into certain provisions of law that are stated to be applicable in the present
case. Much emphasis has been laid on behalf of the appellants that the petitioner-respondent nos.2
to 17 worked in the Industrial Establishment of the Workshop of the Irrigation Department, which is
owned and controlled by the Government of U.P.. The terms 'employer' and 'industrial
establishment' have been defined in Section 2 of the Standing Orders Act as under:-

"(d) "employer" means the owner of an industrial establishment to which this Act for
the time being applies, and includes-

(i) in a factory, any person named under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 7 of
the Factories Act, 1948, as the manager of the factory;

(ii) in any industrial establishment under the control of any department of any
Government in India, the authority appointed by such Government in this behalf, or
where no authority is so appointed, the head of the department;

(iii) in any other industrial establishment, any person responsible to the owner for
the supervision and control of the industrial establishment;

(e) "industrial establishment" means -

(i) an industrial establishment as defined in clause (ii) of Section 2 of the Payment of
Wages Act, 1936, or

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

(ii) a factory as defined in clause (m) of Section 2 of the Factories Act, 1948, or

(iii) .........

(iv) ........."

26. In the Factories Act, 194816, the words 'factory' and 'occupier' have been defined thus:-

"(m) "factory" means any premises including the precincts thereof--

(i) whereon ten or more workers are working, or were working on any day of the
preceding twelve months, and in any part of which a manufacturing process is being
carried on with the aid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on, or

(ii) whereon twenty or more workers are working, or were working on any day of the
preceding twelve months, and in any part of which a manufacturing process is being
carried on without the aid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on,--

but does not include a mine subject to the operation of the Mines Act, 1952 (35 of 1952), or a mobile
unit belonging to the armed forces of the Union, railway running shed or a hotel, restaurant or
eating place.

Explanation I--For computing the number of workers for the purposes of this clause all the workers
in different groups and relays in a day shall be taken into account;

Explanation II.--For the purposes of this clause, the mere fact that an Electronic Data Processing
Unit or a Computer Unit is installed in any premises or part thereof, shall not be construed to make
it a factory if no manufacturing process is being carried on in such premises or part thereof.

(n) "occupier" of a factory means the person who has ultimate control over the affairs of the factoryProvided that--

(i) ........;

(ii) ........;

(iii) in the case of a factory owned or controlled by the Central Government or any State
Government, or any local authority, the person or persons appointed to manage the affairs of the
factory by the Central Government, the State Government or the local authority, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be the occupier: ............"

27. Therefore, the word 'occupier' of a factory in the facts of the present case would mean the person
or persons appointed to manage the affairs of the factory (industrial establishment) by the State

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

Government which owns and controls the factory. Such factories are the aforesaid workshops of the
Irrigation Department.

28. Similarly, the term 'employer' in the Standing Orders Act means the owner of the industrial
establishment, which is the State Government, the industrial establishment being the aforesaid
Workshop of the Irrigation Department, to which the Standing Orders Act for the time being
applies. The term includes, (i) in a factory, any person named under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of
Section 7 of the Factories Act, 1948, as the manager of the factory; (ii) in any industrial
establishment under the control of any department of any Government in India, the authority
appointed by such Government in this behalf, or where no authority is so appointed, the head of the
department; and, (iii) in any other industrial establishment, any person responsible to the owner for
the supervision and control of the industrial establishment.

29. The Factories Act was enacted to regulate factories and to address important basic provisions
relating to health, working hours, holidays, lighting and ventilation, minimum age of employment
and other conditions of working in the factory coupled with the general welfare of the workers. The
Standing Orders Act gives recognition to rights of workman employed in an industrial establishment
which expressly and exclusively deals with the Schedule-enumerated conditions of service of
workmen in industrial establishment.

30. Therefore, the Standing Orders Act and the Factories Act are special enactments that are
applicable to the industrial establishments which may be owned by the State Government. These
enactments seek to specify the conditions of employment of workmen engaged by such
factories/industrial establishments. The Standing Orders Act would apply to every industrial
establishment defined therein subject to the exception sought to be carved out by Section 13-B of the
Standing Orders Act.

31. Section 13-B of the Standing Orders Act, which was inserted by Act No. 36 of 1956 with effect
from 10.3.1957, reads as follows:-

"13B. Act not to apply to certain industrial establishments.--Nothing in this Act shall
apply to an industrial establishment in so far as the workmen employed therein are
persons to whom the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules, Civil Services
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules,
Revised Leave Rules, Civil Service Regulations, Civilians in Defence Service
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules or the Indian Railway Establishment Code
or any other rules or regulations that may be notified in this behalf by the appropriate
Government in the Official Gazette, apply."

The exception carved out by Section 13-B is in respect of such workmen to whom the following rules
or regulations apply:-

(i) Fundamental and Supplementary Rules,

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

(ii) Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules,

(iii) Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules,

(iv) Revised Leave Rules,

(v) Civil Service Regulations,

(vi) Civilians in Defence Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, or

(vii) Indian Railway Establishment Code, or

(viii) any other rules or regulations that may be notified in this behalf by the
appropriate Government in the Official Gazette.

In the aforesaid section, the phrase 'any other rules or regulations' can only mean such rules or
regulations that are notified by the appropriate Government in the Official Gazette under Section
13-B of the Standing Orders Act and to none other. To substantiate exclusion of the application of
the Standing Orders Act in respect of workmen or a set of workmen, the workmen have not only to
show and demonstrate that 'any other rules or regulations' have been framed, but, also that such
rules or regulations have been notified in this behalf, that is to say, under Section 13-B by the
appropriate Government in the Official Gazette.

It is important to note that if any question arises to the application or interpretation of a Standing
Order certified under the Standing Orders Act, then under the provisions of Section 13-A of the
Standing Orders Act, any employer or workman or a Trade Union or other representative body of
the workmen may refer the question to the labour court constituted under the Industrial Disputes
Act and specified for the disposal of such proceedings by the appropriate Government by
notification in the official gazette and the labour court to which the question is so referred shall,
after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard, decide the question and such decision shall be
final and binding on the parties.

32. The scope of Section 13-B of the Standing Orders Act were considered by a three Judge Bench of
the Supreme Court in the case of U.P. State Electricity Board & Ors. vs. Hari Shankar Jain & Ors.17.
The Governor had notified, under Section 13-B of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act,
1946, a regulation made by the U.P. State Electricity Board under Section 79(c) of the Electricity
(Supply) Act, 1948, which prescribed the age of superannuation of employees of the Board. Acting in
pursuance of this regulation as notified by the Governor, the Board sought to retire two employees
on their attaining the age of 58 years. It was observed by the Supreme Court as follows:-

"14. ................. It is true that in S. 13-B the species specifically mentioned happens to
be Government servants. But they also possess this common characteristic that they
are all public servants enjoying a statutory status, and governed by statutory rules
and regulations. If the legislature intended to confine the applicability of S. 13-B to

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

industrial undertakings employing Govt. servants only nothing was easier than to say
so instead of referring to various rules specifically and following it up with a general
expression like the one before us. The words 'rules and regulations' have come to
acquire a special meaning when used in statutes. They are used to describe
subordinate legislation made by authorities to whom the statute delegates that
function. The words can have no other meaning in Sec. 13-B. Therefore, the
expression "workmen ..... to whom ..... any other rules or regulations that may be
notified in this behalf" means, in the context of S. 13-B, workmen enjoying a statutory
status, in respect of whose conditions of service the relevant statute authorises the
making of rules or regulations. The expression cannot be construed so narrowly as to
mean Government servants only; nor can it be construed so broadly as to mean
workmen employed by whomsoever including private employers, so long as their
conditions of service are notified by the Govt. under S. 13-B.

15. .................. In Raman Nambissan's case18 it was held that the mere fact that the
Electricity Board had adopted the rules and regulations of the Government of Madras
as its transitory rules and regulations did not bring the workman employed in
industrial establishments under the Board within the mischief of S. 13-B of the
Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act. In Thiruvenkataswami's case19 it was
held that rules made by the Government under the District Municipalities Act could
not be considered to be rules notified under S. 13-B of the Standing Orders Act
merely because the rules were made by the Government and published in
G o v e r n m e n t G a z e t t e . W e a g r e e w i t h t h e c o n c l u s i o n s i n b o t h c a s e s . I n
Thiruvenkataswami's case Kailasam, J. also observed that the Industrial Employment
(Standing Orders) Act was a special act relating exclusively to the service conditions
of persons employed in industrial establishments, and, therefore, its provisions
prevailed over the provisions of the District Municipalities Act. We entirely agree.
But, the learned Judge went on to say 'S. 13-B cannot be availed of for purposes of
framing rules to govern the relationships in an industrial establishment under private
management or in a Statutory Corporation. This rule can apply only to industrial
establishments in respect of which the Government is authorised to frame rules and
regulations relating to the conditions of employment in industrial establishments."
There we disagree. Our disagreement however is only in regard to industrial
establishments under Statutory Corporations which are authorised by statute to
make rules and regulations and not in regard to those under Statutory Corporations
not so authorised, nor in regard to those under private management. Our reasons are
mentioned in the previous paragraph.

16. ............... The words 'nothing in this Act shall apply' are not to be interpreted too
literally as to lead to absurd results and to what the Legislature never intended. In
our view the only reasonable construction that we can put upon the language of S.
13-B is that a rule or regulation, if notified by the Government, will exclude the
applicability of the Act to the extent that the rule or regulation covers the field. To
that extent and to that extent only 'nothing in the Act shall apply'. To understand S.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

13-B in any other manner will lead to unjust and uncontemplated results. For
instance, most of the Service Rules and Regulations expressly mentioned in Sec. 13-B
do not deal with a large number of the matters enumerated in the schedule such as
'Manner of intimating to workmen periods and hour of work, holidays, pay-days and
wage rates', 'shift working', 'Attendance and late coming', 'conditions of, procedure in
applying for, and the authority which may grant leave and holidays', 'Closing and
reopening of Sections of the industrial establishments and temporary stoppages of
work and the rights and liabilities of the employer and workmen arising therefrom'
etc. To exclude the applicability of Standing Orders relating to all these matters
because the Fundamental Rules, the Civil Service Rules or the Civil Services
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules provide for a few matters like
'Classification of workmen' or 'suspension or dismissal for misconduct' would be to
reverse the processes of history, apart from leading to unjust and untoward results. It
will place workmen once again at the mercy of the employer be he ever so benign and
it will certainly promote industrial strife. We have indicated what according to us is
the proper construction of S. 13-B. That is the only construction which gives meaning
and sense to Section 13-B and that is a construction which can legitimately be said to
conform to the Directive Principles of State Policy proclaimed in Articles 42 and 43 of
the Constitution.

17. We, therefore, hold that the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act is a
special law in regard to the matters enumerated in the schedule and the regulations
made by the Electricity Board with respect to any of those matters are of no effect
unless such regulations are either notified by the Government under S. 13-B or
certified by the Certifying Officer under S. 5 of the Industrial Employment (Standing
Orders) Act. In regard to matters in respect of which regulations made by the Board
have not been notified by the Governor or in respect of which no regulations have
been made by the Board, the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act shall
continue to apply. In the present case the regulation made by the Board with regard
to age of superannuation having been duly notified by the Government, the
regulation shall have effect notwithstanding the fact that it is a matter which could be
the subject-matter of Standing Orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing
Orders) Act. The respondents were therefore, properly retired when they attained the
age of 58 years. The appeal is, therefore, allowed. The Writ Petition filed in the High
Court is dismissed. The appellants will pay the costs of the respondents as directed by
this Court on 28-9-77. The costs are quantified at Rs.3500/-."

33. In the case of Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation vs. Krishna Kant20, while dealing
with the issue relating to the nature and character of the Certified Standing Orders, the Supreme
Court observed that they are not in the nature of delegated/ subordinate legislation. It was observed
that the Standing Orders do not say that on such certification of the Standing Orders, they acquire
statutory effect or become part of the statute, though they are undoubtedly binding upon both the
employer and the employees and constitute the conditions of service of the employees. The Supreme
Court held that it appears difficult to say, on principle, that they have statutory force. The Supreme

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

Court, after referring to various decisions, observed as follows:-

"18. ................. The consensus of these decisions is: the certified Standing Orders
constitute statutory terms and conditions of service. Though we have some
reservations as to the basis of the above dicta as pointed out supra, we respectfully
accept it both on the ground of stare decisis as well as judicial discipline. Even so, we
are unable to say that they constitute "statutory provisions" within the meaning of the
dicta in Sukhdev Singh [(1975) 1 SCC 421 : 1975 SCC (L&S) 101 : (1975) 3 SCR 619]
where it was held: (SCC p. 447, para 67) "The employees of these statutory bodies
have a statutory status and they are entitled to declaration of being in employment
when their dismissal or removal is in contravention of statutory provisions."

Indeed, if it is held that certified Standing Orders constitute statutory provisions or have statutory
force, a writ petition would also lie for their enforcement just as in the case of violation of the Rules
made under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. Neither a suit would be necessary nor a
reference under Industrial Disputes Act. We do not think the certified Standing Orders can be
elevated to that status. It is one thing to say that they are statutorily imposed conditions of service
and an altogether different thing to say that they constitute statutory provisions themselves."

34. The aforesaid judgment in Krishna Kant has been relied upon in the judgment of Rajasthan
State Road Transport Corporation vs. Deen Dayal Sharma21. The judgment in Deen Dayal Sharma
has been adverted to by the learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the appellants to
contend that the remedy of the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 for enforcement of their rights
under the Certified Standing Orders made under the Standing Orders Act would be to seek a
reference of the dispute before the appropriate forum constituted under the U.P. Industrial Dispute
Act, 1947.

35. Admittedly, the conditions of service of the petitioner nos. 2 to 17 were governed by the Standing
Orders Act. They were availing of the benefits and were being governed by the procedural and other
terms of the certified Standing Orders that were applicable to them in the industrial
establishments/Workshops of the Irrigation Department of the State Government they were
working in. They were seeking enforcement of the provisions of the Standing Orders Act by
resorting to legal remedies under the provisions of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act. However, their
claim to pension is solely on the basis of their stand that the Rules, 1984 is applicable to them. In the
aforesaid background, we may proceed to consider the Rules, 1984 and their applicability to the
petitioner nos. 2 to 17.

36. With regard to the applicability of the Rules, 1984, which has been held by the learned Judge to
be applicable to the petitioner-respondent nos.2 to 17 and which has been disputed by the
appellants, the observations by the Supreme Court in Hari Shankar Jain (supra) with regard to
"rules" referred to in Section 13B of the Standing Orders Act would have to be seen. While
addressing the arguments of the learned counsel before the Supreme Court that the rules and
regulations which have been specifically mentioned in Section 13B were all comprehensive sets of
rules and, therefore, the phrase "any other rules or regulations" that might be notified by the

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

Government should also satisfy the test of comprehensiveness, and that it could not be said that
notifying of a single rule or regulation would exclude the applicability of all provisions of the
Standing Orders Act, the Supreme Court in Hari Shankar Jain observed that the only reasonable
construction that can be put upon the language of Section 13B is that a rule or regulation, if notified
by the Government, will exclude the applicability of the Standing Orders Act to the extent that the
rule or regulation covers the field. For instance, most of the service rules and regulations expressly
mentioned in Section 13B do not deal with the large number of matters enumerated in the Schedule
to the Standing Orders Act.

37. The Supreme Court went on to further observe in Hari Shankar Jain (supra) that in regard to
matters in respect of which the regulations made by the Board (under the Electricity Supply Act)
had not been notified by the Governor or in respect of which no regulations had been made by the
Board, the Standing Orders Act would continue to apply.

38. Therefore, keeping in mind the ratio decidendi of the judgment in Hari Shankar Jain, coupled
with the fact that it has been stated in the affidavit of 18.10.2021 filed on behalf of the
appellant-State that the Irrigation Workshop Circle, Kanpur had administrative control over the
workshops in Roorkee, Bareilly, Meerut, Jhansi and Kanpur in the State of Uttar Pradesh prior to
1994, the Rules, 1984 may be considered.

39. A coordinate Bench of this Court in Om Prakash was considering the aspect regarding the age of
retirement of the employees working at Kanpur Workshop observed as follows-

"10. The controversy, therefore, in the present case is as to whether the Certified
Standing Orders would be applicable in the case in hand in spite of the fact that the
appellants themselves have framed the Rules of 1984. The appellants in their own
wisdom has taken a decision to make the service Rules in 1984 and those Rules have
been prevailing since then. Rule-8 specifies the category of posts and also specifies
the post in Appendix-A. The posts, therefore, which are included within the ambit of
the Rules, will fall exclusively within the domain of the Rules and the Certified
Standing Orders cannot be said to be applicable in respect of these posts.

11. Learned Additional Advocate General has drawn the attention of the Court
towards Rule-25 of the Rules and on that basis, it has been submitted that since no
age of retirement has been prescribed under the Rules, therefore, the Certified
Standing Orders would be applicable wherein the date of retirement is mentioned as
58 years.

12. The aforesaid argument has to be tested in the light of the language used in
Rule-25 of the Rules, which says that in respect of the matters, which have not been
provided in these Rules or special orders, the provisions related to State Government
employees will apply. The applicability of the Rules has to be tested in the light of the
fact that the Certified Standing Orders came into existence after promulgation of the
Rules and the appellants consciously framed the Rules so as to place the category of

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

persons indicated in the Rules outside the ambit of the Certified Standing Orders.
The Certified Standing Orders, therefore, in the wake of the Rules framed by the
appellants would not apply in respect of the category of employees, who are falling
under Rule-8 and Appendix-A of the Rules.

13. The Division Bench of this Court while considering the issue at Allahabad22 was
seized with the matter, in respect of which, no Rules were existing and neither
framed in respect of Allahabad Workshop. In those very circumstances, the Division
Bench came to the conclusion that until and unless there is declaration as
contemplated under Section 13-B, the Government Servant Rules will not be
applicable, but in the case in hand, the appellants themselves have framed the Rules
and the employees have been subjected to the aforesaid Rules, and whatever has not
been provided in these Rules, the same will be adopted from the Rules applicable in
respect of U.P. State Government employees, so in these circumstances, if the age of
retirement has not been provided in these Rules, then the age of retirement, which is
applicable in respect of U.P. State Government employees would be applicable.

14. The argument of learned Additional Advocate General that the Certified Standing
Orders would be applicable, relying upon the judgment of the apex court in the case
of The U.P. State Electricity Board and another vs. Hari Shankar Jain and others
(1978) 4 SCC 16, does not come to the rescue of the appellants on account of the fact
that in the said case, in Para-10 of the judgment, it has been held as under:

"10. We have already shown that the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act is
a special Act dealing with a specific subject, namely the conditions of service,
enumerated in the schedule, of workmen in industrial establishments. It is
impossible to conceive that Parliament sought to abrogate the provisions of the
Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act embodying as they do hard-won and
precious rights of workmen and prescribing as they do an elaborate procedure,
including a quasi-judicial determination, by a general, incidental provision like
Section 79(c) of the Electricity (Supply) Act. It is obvious that Parliament did not
have before it the Standing Orders Act when it passed the Electricity Supply Act and
Parliament never meant that the Standing Orders Act should stand pro tanto
repealed by Section 79(c) of the Electricity Supply Act. We are clearly of the view that
the provisions of the Standing Orders Act must prevail over Section 79(c) of the
Electricity Supply Act, in regard to matters to which the Standing Orders Act
applies."

15. In the aforesaid case, the situation was otherwise, wherein the Electricity Supply Act was framed
prior to promulgation of the Standing Orders and therein, the Supreme Court came to the
conclusion that special rule excludes the general will not apply in that case because the special
provision was in existence prior to promulgation of the Act of 1946.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

16. Here, in the case in hand, the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act, 1946 was framed and
thereafter the Certified Standing Orders were framed and the Rules have been framed in 1984 and
the said Rules are applicable in respect of the employees of Kanpur Workshop. The State
Government was conscious of the fact and, therefore, took a conscious decision and framed the
Rules so as to keep the employees of the Kanpur Workshop outside the purview of the Certified
Standing Orders, otherwise there would have been no necessity of providing under Rule-25 of the
Rules that whatever has not been provided in these Rules, the same shall be adopted from the State
Government employees Rules and shall be applicable in respect of present employees."

40. With all due respect to the judgment of the Bench in Om Prakash, the ratio in the matter of Hari
Shakar Jain is not only that the special rule excludes the general, but that the only reasonable
construction that could be put upon the language of Section 13B of the Standing Orders Act, is that a
rule or regulation, if notified by the Government, will exclude the applicability of the Standing
Orders Act to the extent that the rule or regulation covers the field. Further, such a rule or regulation
has to be notified under Section 13-B of the Standing Orders Act, which aspect was specifically
indicated in Hari Shankar Jain and reiterated by a Division Bench of this Court in the aforesaid case
of Motilal Kushwaha. Though the judgment of Motilal Kushwaha was considered in Om Prakash but
was sought to be distinguished.

41. Now, to consider the Rules, 1984, Rule 2 of the Rules, 1984 deals with the service comprising
Group C and Group D posts. Rule 3 contains definitions. Clauses (i), (j) and (k) of which read as
follows:

"(i) 'Service' means the Utter Pradesh Irrigation Department (Irrigation Workshop
Circle, Kanpur) Semi Technical Service;

(j) 'Substantive appointment' means an appointment, not being an ad hoc
appointment, on a post in the cadre of the service, made after selection in accordance
with the rules and, if there were no rules, in accordance with the procedure
prescribed for the time being by executive instructions issued by the Government;

(k) 'Year of recruitment' means a period of twelve months commencing on the first
day of July of a calendar year."

Part-II of the Rules, 1984 deals with the cadre of service. Rule 4 reads as follows:

"4. (1) The strength of the service and each category of posts therein shall be such as
may be determined by the Government from time to time.

(2) The strength of the service and each category of posts therein shall, until orders
varying the same are passed under sub-rule(1), be as has been given in the Columns
No.3 to 5 of Appendix 'A', provided that;

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

(One) The appointing authority may leave unfilled or the Governor may hold in
abeyance any vacant post, without thereby entitling any person to compensating;

(Two) The Governor may create such additional permanent or temporary posts as he
may consider proper."

Part-III of the Rules, 1984 deals with recruitment and the source of recruitment. Rule 5 specifies
that the recruitment to the various categories of posts in the service shall be made from the sources
mentioned opposite to each post in Column No. 9 of Appendix 'A'. Part-IV of the Rules deals with
the qualifications which specifies nationality, academic qualification, preferential qualification, age
and character. Further, marital status and physical fitness are also specified therein. Part-V deals
with the procedure for recruitment which consists of Rules 14, 15 and 16. Rule 14 deals with
determination of vacancies and it reads as follows:

"14. The Appointing Authority shall also determine number of vacancies to be filled
during the course of the year through direct recruitment and also the number of
vacancies reserved for under rule 6 and he shall intimate this information to the
Employment Exchange according to rules and orders prevailing."

Rule 15 provides for procedure for direct recruitment and Rule 16 provides for procedure
recruitment through promotion. Part-VI pertains to appointment, probation, confirmation and
seniority. Part-VII of the Rules deals with pay etc.. Scales of pay are specified in Rule 21. Pay during
probation falls under Rule 22. Rule 23 deals with the criteria for crossing the efficiency bar.
Part-VIII deals with other provisions regarding canvassing which is prohibited under Rule 24. Rules
25 and 26 read as follows:

"25. In regard to the matters not specifically covered by these rules or special orders
persons appointed to the service shall be governed by the rules, regulations and
orders applicable generally to Government servants serving in connection with the
affairs of the State.

26. When the State Government is satisfied that the operation of any rule regulating
the conditions of service of persons appointed to the service causes undue hardship
in any particular case, he may, notwithstanding anything contained in these rules
applicable to the case, by order dispense with or relax the requirements of that rule to
such extent and subject to such conditions as may consider necessary for dealing with
the case in a just and equitable manner."

Appendix 'A' to the Rules specifics the various posts and the number of posts which includes
permanent and temporary workmen, the scales of pay, the appointing authority, and the source of
recruitment.

42. The Rules, 1984 were framed in exercise of powers conferred by proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution of India but have not been notified under Section 13-B of the Standing Orders Act. In

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

this regard, in the case of Raman Nambissan (supra) relied upon before the Supreme Court in Hari
Shankar Jain and the judgment of Thiruvenkataswami (supra) to the extent it was affirmed by the
Supreme Court are illustrative.

It is pertinent to mention here that even in the case of Hari Shankar Jain, the Supreme Court had
held that the regulations made by the Electricity Board with respect to any of those matters
enumerated in the Schedule of the Standing Orders Act are of no effect unless such regulations are
either notified by the Government under Section 13-B or certified by the Certifying Officer under
Section 5 of the Standing Orders Act. Therefore, the judgment in Om Prakash cannot be considered
as a binding precedent.

43. Moreover, in Section 13-B of the Standing Orders Act, the usage of the phrase 'in so far as the
workmen employed therein are persons to whom ........ apply', indicates that in an industrial
establishment there may be a separate class of workmen of the regular or permanent establishment
to whom the rules named in Section 13-B or 'any other rules or regulations that may be notified in
this behalf', applies. It also indicates that in the same industrial establishment there may be another
class of workmen to whom the rules referred to in Section 13-B do not apply. The words "in so far
as" mean 'to the extent'. So on a plain reading of Section 13-B, it reflects that it recognises the
existence of the aforesaid two classes of workmen existing in one industrial establishment. Having
such separate classes of workmen by the State Government in the same industrial establishment
with each class being subject to separate enactments cannot be said to be discriminatory or arbitrary
in view of the provisions of the Factories Act and the Standing Orders Act in general, and, in view of
Section 13-B of the Standing Orders Act aforesaid in particular.

44. It has not been stated in writ petition that the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 were
regularized in service after coming into force of the Rules, 1984 and against existing vacant posts as
provided in the Rules, 1984. They were working since prior to 1984 and were initially working on
daily wage basis. Though it has been stated that the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 were
regularized, and this has not been denied by the appellant, no order or letter of regularization of
service has been produced by the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 to demonstrate that their
regularization was against particular vacant posts specified in the Rules, 1984.

45. With regard to the payment of pensions, the Civil Services Regulations, as adopted in its
application in Uttar Pradesh are required to be seen.

46. Regulation 350 of the Civil Service Regulations, as adopted in its application in Uttar Pradesh is
as under:-

"350. All establishments whether temporary or permanent, shall be deemed to be
pensionable establishments;

Provided that it is open to the State Government to rule that the service in any
establishment does not qualify for pension.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

1. Service in Dak Bungalow and District Garden Establishments does not qualify.

2. The service of a Patwari, whether appointed before or after the abolition of the
Patwari or Village Officers' Cases and Funds, does not qualify in any case in which it
did not qualify prior to that abolition.

3. Service in non-gazetted posts in Government Technical and Industrial institutions
in the Uttar Pradesh does not qualify in the case of persons appointed to such posts
on or after November 15,1938.

Exceptions--This rule does not apply to the posts declared pensionable in Shram
(Kha) Vibhag G.O. No. 810 (E) XXXVI-B- -106/56, dated May 29, 1963 and Udyog
(Gha) Vibhag G.O. No. 375-ED/XVII-D-AQ-19-ED,60, dated June 5,1963."

47. As stated in the affidavits filed by the appellants, the Rules, 1984 provide for 97 regular posts
whereas in the year 1976 there were 927 sanctioned posts of industrial workmen in the various
Workshop Divisions. The contention is that the petitioner-respondent Nos. 2 to 17 were engaged in
the industrial establishment and covered under the Standing Orders Act and were not permanent
workmen covered under the Rules, 1984.

48. In the aforesaid conspectus, it cannot be stated that the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 were
'appointed to the service' as per the usage of the phrase in Rule 25 of the Rules, 1984 or 'member of
the service' as defined in clause (h) of Rule 2 of the Rules, 1984. It is the categorical stand of the
appellants that the Rules, 1984 are inapplicable to the petitioners-respondent nos.2 to 17. The
employees, who are in receipt of pension from the State Government are those who were technical
employees in the regular establishment. The proviso to Regulation 350 of the Civil Service
Regulations as adopted in its application in Uttar Pradesh also leaves it open to the State
Government to rule that the service in any establishment does not qualify for pension.

49. In the case of State of U.P. and Others Vs. Gorakh Nath Pandey and Others23, a Division Bench
of this Court, while considering an intra-Court Appeal against the order of a learned Single Judge
directing payment of pension and other retiral dues to the petitioners who answered the description
of the industrial employees/workmen within the meaning to be assigned for the parties under the
Standing Orders Act and the conditions of their employment governed by the Standing Orders
applicable to the U.P. Government Cement Factory Churk, Mirzapur, considered the provisions of
Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations and observed that the provisions therein are a
beneficial piece of legislation and there was no reason found to exclude persons covered by certified
Standing Orders from the benefits of Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations, if they satisfy
the other requirements of Regulation 361. It was held that even a workmen/industrial employee of
Government Industrial Undertaking has to be held to be a civil servant/holder of a civil post under
the Government. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.

As would be evident hereinafter, this judgment in Gorakh Nath Pandey would not operate as a
precedent, nor are the facts therein similar to that of the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 in the

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

present case.

50. Another coordinate Bench of this Court in an intra-Court Appeal in the case of State of U.P. and
Others Vs. Shiv Jag Sharma and Others24 considered a matter that was identical to the matter
adjudicated in Gorakh Nath Pandey. It noted the order dated 1.5.2018 passed by the Supreme Court
in the Special Leave Petition filed against the judgment in Gorakh Nath Pandey, which is as follows:-

"Delay condoned.

Application for exemption from filing official translation is allowed.

In the peculiar facts of this case, we are not inclined to exercise our jurisdiction under
Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Hence, this special leave petition is
dismissed, leaving the question of law open.

Needless to say that the impugned judgment may not be treated as precedent."

51. The Bench in Shiv Jag Sharma explained the judgment of the Division Bench in Gorakh Nath
Pandey and went on to observe as follows-

"20. While the Supreme Court may not have fully approved and thus affirmed the
order of the co-ordinate Bench, it did not reverse the same and in any case, it did not
lay down any contrary law. The later observation made in that order leaving the
question of law open and not for that reason allowing that decision of the co-ordinate
bench to be made precedent, only indicates that the same is not to be applied by way
of reasoning if facts are different.

21. Insofar as the same facts are shown to exist in the present case as existed in
Gorakh Nath Pandey (supra), peculiarity of facts noted by the Supreme Court in the
third paragraph of its order dated 1.5.2018 obtains in the present case, as well. It is
not the case of the State-respondents that the present set of respondents stand on a
different footing than the petitioners in Gorak Nath Pandey (supra). Therefore, while
no law may have arisen as may bind the Court in future decisions, at the same time,
the rule of consistency and principles of equity would dictate, the Court may not draw
any distinction as may itself lead to equals being treated unequally. Relying on a
decision of the Supreme Court in Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme of 2002 of
Azam Jahi Mill Workers Association Vs. National Textile Corporation Limited and
others; [2021 (4) ESC 880 (SC), it has been strenuously urged that the Court itself
may not pass any order as may result in equals being treated unequally. As to delay, it
has been submitted, neither such ground was raised before the learned single judge
nor there is any inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner in the present case.
These petitions were filed immediately after pronouncement by the learned single
judge in Gorakh Nath Pandey (supra).

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

22. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the record, we
find the coordinate Bench in Gorakh Nath Pandey (supra) had the occasion to deal
with the exact same submissions being advanced in the present appeal. There also, an
issue had been raised that exactly similarly situated workmen of a cement factory
established by the State Government may not have been equated to civil servants
and, therefore, they may not be found entitled to pensionary benefits under
Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations. Pertinent to the dispute before us, the
co-ordinate bench had observed as under:

"Crux of the submission of the learned Advocate General therefore, is what once the
petitioners are found to answer the description of workmen/industrial employees
within the meaning of to be assigned under the Standing Orders Act, they stand
excluded from the definition of a person appointed to a civil post or in civil service
within the meaning of U.P. Fundamental Rules/Civil Service Regulations and
therefore they are not entitled to pension.

We specifically inquired from the learned Advocate General as to under which
provision of the U.P. Fundamental Rules/Civil Service Regulations/Standing Orders
Act, any such exclusion in respect of the persons who are workmen are not being a
person appointed to a civil post. No response could be given. It is more or less an
a d m i t t e d p o s i t i o n t h a t t h e r e i s n o s p e c i f i c p r o v i s i o n f o r e x c l u d i n g t h e
workmen/industrial employees in the matter of payment of pension/retiral dues,
who otherwise satisfy all the conditions as contemplates by Regulation 361 of the
Civil Service Regulations.

The Standing Orders Act has been enforced with an object to law down the condition
of service like disciplinary action, leave, allowances etc. so as to minimize the fraction
between the workmen and employer in Industrial Undertaking. Such Industrial
Undertaking can be private undertaking or Government Undertaking or Public
Private Undertaking. It is useful to refer to the definition of employer contained in
Section 2 (d) (ii) of the Act, 1946, which reads as follows:

"2. Interpretation.

(d) "employer".......

(ii) in any industrial establishment under the control of any department of any
Government in India, the authority appointed by such Government in this behalf, or
where no authority is so appointed, the head of the department;"

Thus, it will be seen that a Government may own industrial undertaking and in that circumstance, a
employee working in such an industrial undertaking has to be held to be in service of Government
and if the appointment is substantive and his service is to be paid by the Government, he stands
covered by the provisions of Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations, which entitles him to

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

pension.

For ready reference, Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations reads as under:

"361. The service of an officer does not qualify for pension unless it conforms to the
following three conditions:---

First-The service must be under Government.

Second-The employment must be substantive and permanent.

Third-The service must be paid by Government."

We may explain that use of the word "civil service" under Civil Service Regulations has to be read to
include all nature of employment in the Government, except those which are in relation to defence
service or service connected with defence.

Civil Service as defined in The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition by Houghton
Mifflin Company reads as under:

"The nonmilitary personnel who work for a government, applying its laws and
regulations."

In our opinion the service conditions laid down as per the Certified Standing Orders, the Act, 1946
do not in any way impinge upon the right of a employee working in a Government Industrial
Undertaking to be entitled to pension and other retiral dues under Regulation 361 of Civil Service
Regulations. Provisions of Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations are a beneficial piece of
legislation and we do not find any reason for the persons who are covered by the Certified Standing
Orders to be excluded from the benefits of Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations, if they
satisfy the other requirements of Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations.

In our opinion even a workman/industrial employee of Government Industrial Undertaking has to
be held to be a civil servant/holder of a civil post under the Government so as to be covered within
the meaning of Regulation 361 of the Civil Service Regulations.

There is no issue with regard to other employees appointed in Factory at Churk and subsequently
absorbed in the Corporation being paid pension in terms of the Government Order dated 2nd
August, 2005.

We for the reasons recorded above see no reason as to why the workmen/industrial employees
similarly appointed and absorbed be denied the same benefit. It is held that petitioners who answer
the description of industrial employees/workmen shall also be covered by the Government Order
dated 2nd August, 2005 and would be entitled to all benefits following therefrom.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

In the totality of the circumstances on record we do not find any substance in the contentions raised
by the learned Advocate General for the State to interfere with the judgment and order of the
learned Single Judge dated 12th April, 2016.

All these appeals lack merit and are accordingly dismissed."

23. Thus, we find, exact same submission had been raised before the coordinate Bench. It had been
dealt with and repelled on the reasoning that the petitioners (in that case), were specifically included
for the purpose of grant of pensionary benefit upon the decision made by the State Government
dated 02.08.2005. Even today, it is no one's case that the above Office Order issued by the
Commissioner and Director, Industries, Government of U.P., was later withdrawn or amended, at
any subsequent date. That decision of the State Government has not only remained in existence, but
it was also enforced against the State Government in Gorakh Nath Pandey (supra).

24. Therefore, the mere reference to the Standing Order containing the terms and conditions of
engagement of the petitioners-respondents as workmen establishes that technically it is true that the
workmen of the industrial establishment may stand on a different footing than an employee of the
State Government enjoying status of an employee engaged under separate Rules. That technical
deficiency of status though may always be recognized by the Courts, yet, it is always open to the
State-government/employer to still treat its workmen equal to its other employees, for grant of
pensionary benefit. .............

.................

.................

39. Having failed to establish any distinction before the co-ordinate bench, in Gorakh Nath Pandey
(surpa), and that decision having not been upturned by the Supreme Court, we do not find this a fit
case to interfere on the submission advanced by the learned Additional Advocate General that the
basic difference in status between a civil servant and an industrial workman, must always maintain.
The respondent-appellant/State may not be permitted to re-agitate that issue, in these proceedings.
That exercise, if permitted, may only lead to absolute equals being treated unequally by the writ
Court. Thus, we do not find the equities being pitted against the law; rather, we find, in the present
facts, the equities are running parallel to the result that arose in law i.e., upon dismissal of the
Special Leave Petition in Gorakh Nath Pandey (supra).

40. Since the equality claimed was to a final order of a coordinate bench that has attained finality, it
is that 'law' that the present set of petitioners-appellants sought benefit of, on an equitable principle.
It has been granted by the learned single judge in exercise of the extraordinary discretionary
jurisdiction of the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

41. In the context of service jurisprudence, the normal rule remains i.e. when a particular set of
employees is given relief by the Court, all other identically situated persons are to be treated alike by
extending that benefit. Not extending that benefit would itself amount to discrimination in violation

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

of Article 14 of the Constitution of India................... "

52. After considering a gamut of case laws, the writ petition of Shiv Jag Sharma was
allowed.

53. It is pertinent to mention here that the judgment in Shiv Jag Sharma followed
Gorakh Nath Pandey only because of equitable considerations given the fact that the
petitioners in Shiv Jag Sharma were identically placed as the petitioners in Gorakh
Nath Pandey.

54. It is important to note here that the question in this appeal is not whether the
petitioner-respondent Nos. 2 to 17 are entitled to pension, but, whether pension is
payable to them either by the State Government or under the Pension Scheme.
Pertinently and admittedly, the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 had voluntarily
subscribed to the Pension Scheme and their contributions as well as the contribution
of the employer were deposited. Admittedly, two of the petitioner-respondents
submitted Form 10-D and are availing of pension under the Pension Scheme.

55. In the case of Prabhu Narain v. State of U.P.25, the Supreme Court held that to
receive pension the employees must establish that they are entitled to pension under
a particular rule or scheme.

56. A coordinate bench of this Court in the matter of C/M U.P. Rajkiya Roadways
Parivahan Nigam Sewa Nivrat and another v. State of U.P. and another26 observed
as follows:-

"38. To sum up, we state that the concept of pension has been considered by Apex
Court time and again and in catena of cases noted above, it has been observed that
the Pension is not a charity or bounty nor is it a conditional payment solely
dependent on the sweet will of the employer. It is earned for rendering a long and
satisfactory service. It is in the nature of deferred payment for past services. It is a
social security plan consistent with the socioeconomic requirements of the
Constitution when the employer is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution rendering social justice to a superannuated government servant. It is a
right attached to the office and cannot be arbitrarily denied i.e. the payment of it does
not depend upon the discretion of the Employee but is governed by the Rules/Policy
and incumbent falling within the purview of those Rules/Policy is entitled to claim
pension. Right to receive pension flows by virtue of Rules/Policy holding the field."

57. The judgment in the aforesaid case of C/M U.P. Rajkiya Roadways Parivahan Nigam Sewa Nivrat
has been affirmed by the Supreme Court in the recent case of U.P. Roadways Retired Officials &
Officers Assn. v. State of U.P.and another27, in which case the Supreme Court observed as follows:-

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

"46. The common thread in the abovereferred judgments of this Court is that pension
is a right and not a bounty. It is a constitutional right for which an employee is
entitled on his superannuation. However, pension can be claimed only when it is
permissible under the relevant rules or a scheme. If an employee is covered under the
Provident Fund Scheme and is not holding a pensionable post, he cannot claim
pension, nor the writ court can issue mandamus directing the employer to provide
pension to an employee who is not covered under the rules."

58. It is the specific case of the appellant that the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 are covered by
the Pension Scheme, that they have withdrawn their provident fund dues that had accumulated
under the Provident Fund Scheme framed under the EPF Act. It is pertinent to mention here that in
paragraph no. 22 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the appellants in the writ petition, it has
been stated that the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 were each asked to submit "Pension
Prapatra-10-D" by means of separate letters, but that Prapatra were not filled up by the petitioners.
This averment has not been denied in the rejoinder affidavit filed by the petitioner-respondents in
the writ petition.

59. The aspect of payment of pension under the Pensions Scheme is not dislodged by the Rules,
1984 as far as pension payable to the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 is concerned. As far as the
conditions of service of the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 were concerned, the same were
admittedly governed by the Certified Standing orders. The said petitioners opted for the benefits of
provident fund and pension under the Provident Fund Scheme and the Pension Scheme respectively
framed under the provisions of the EPF Act. Therefore, now these petitioners cannot turn around
and stake any valid claim to pension from the State Government for want of any specific rule or
government order in this regard. Moreover, they cannot lay any claim to pension from the State
Government on equitable considerations. The fact that they were initially appointed on daily wages
is not disputed. They claim that their services were regularized. Therefore, the Government Orders
of 13.11.2007 and 27.2.2009 provided that they were government servants and entitled to D.A. and
time scale as applicable to regular government servants. But that would not confer any entitlement
on the petitioners to stake claim to pension from the State Government in view of the fact that these
petitioners were not regularized in the regular establishment.

60. As far as allegation of discrimination is concerned, in paragraph no. 26 of the writ petition filed
by the petitioners, it is alleged that five employees were similarly situated as the petitioners and they
have received retiral benefits and are getting pension at par with Government Employees; (1) Ram
Dev Singh, (2) Islamuddin, (3) Suresh Chand Sharma, (4) Ram Asrey Lal and (5) Chhote Lal.

In reply thereof, in paragraph no. 20 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the appellants, the
allegation has been denied and in reply it has been submitted that referenced employee no. 1 and 2
retired from Irrigation Workshop Division, Meerut, the employee nos. 3, 4 and 5 retired from the
Irrigation Workshop Division, Izzatnagar, Bareily according to the service condition of regular
employees not from the Industrial Establishment, while the petitioner nos. 2 to 17 have been retired
from the Industrial Establishment. In the rejoinder affidavit, however, the contents of paragraph no.
20 of the counter affidavit have not been denied.

State Of U.P. And 4 Others vs Sinchai Mazdoor Sangh Uttar Pradesh And ... on 17 January, 2025

As already held herein above, the petitioner-respondent nos. 2 to 17 have not been able to
demonstrate that they were regularised in the regular or permanent establishment. Under the
circumstances, the petitioners have not been able to demonstrate any discrimination qua the
aforementioned five persons.

61. In the judgment of Prem Singh, the Supreme Court dealt with the question whether the period of
work charged services could be excluded from qualifying service for pension, and, in our humble
opinion, the same would not apply in the facts and circumstances of the present case. Moreover, the
appellant before the Supreme Court in Prem Singh had been regularized in service in the regular
establishment. Therefore, the period of work charged services of such employees was the relevant
consideration for purpose of qualifying service for payment of pension.

62. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the present Special Appeal is allowed. The
impugned judgment of the learned Judge is set aside.

63. Learned counsel for the appellants have stated that this special appeal is directed against an
order passed by this Court following the judgment dated 14.1.2020 passed by learned Judge in
Writ-A No. 12780 of 2018, the special appeal filed against which was the aforesaid Special Appeal
No. 232 of 2020 which has been allowed.

64. Though, on perusal of the memo of appeal, it appears that immediately after array of parties, a
statement has been made that the special appeal is preferred against the impugned judgment and
order dated 11.11.2020, passed in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 18517 of 2018 (Ram Chandra Vs.
State of U.P. and others), however, on perusal of the relief clause, it appears that it is directed
against the judgment and order dated 31.8.2021, passed in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 222 of 2021
(Sinchai Workshop Mazdoor Union an others Vs. State of U.P. and others.). The grounds raised in
the memo of appeal are also directed in respect of judgment and order dated 31.8.2021 in Writ-A
No. 222 of 2021. On perusal of the judgment and order dated 31.8.2021 enclosed with the Special
Appeal, it reflects that the writ petition was allowed in terms of the judgment dated 14.1.2020
