6. Darshan Singh was an illiterate person. He is stated to have been accompanying PW−
1 in a police vehicle while on official duty along with ASI Balwinder Singh. This to our
mind, is certainly not in the normal course of events. The consent memo Exhibit−

then handed over to ASI Balwinder Singh. The case property was retained by PW−1 in his
possession and was not deposited in the malkhana nor entered in the roznamcha. There
is no explanation for the same. The sample was retained by PW−1 in his private
custody in a rented accommodation. No explanation is forthcoming from the

on patrol duty, the individual being an illiterate, but having signed the consent memo were
surely matters for investigation. Similarly, why the signature of ASI Balwinder Singh or PW−
4 was not obtained on the consent memo was again a subject matter of investigation.

1 and that sent for chemical analysis. The mere fact that there may have been a seal cannot
lead to any presumption in absence of the examination of ASI Balwinder Singh. Likewise,
it was also a subject of investigation why PW−1 did not make any roznamcha entry of the

investigator been different from the complainant, the issues for consideration may have been

entirely different. The appellant in his defence under Section 313 Cr.P.C. had specifically
t a k e n a p l e a o f f a l s e i m p l i c a t i o n b y P W − 1 o n
account of a dispute with regard to purchase of a tractor.

8. The view taken by the High Court that under Section 55 of the NDPS Act, that PW−
1 was empowered to keep the case property and sample in his individual safe custody is
completely erroneous on the face of it. The provision reads as follows:

“55. Police to take charge of articles seized and delivered− An officer−in−
charge of a police station shall take charge of and keep in safe custody, pending the
o r d e r s o f t h e M a g i s t r a t e , a l l a r t i c l e s s e i z e d u n d e r

to him, and shall allow any officer who may accompany such articles to

all samples so taken shall also be sealed with a seal of the officer−in−charge of
p o l i c e s t a t i o n . ” ( e m p h a s i s a d d e d )
t h e
A plain reading of the provision makes it manifest that it is the duty of the
police officer to deposit the seized material in the police station malkhana.

The samples should be sent either by insured post or through special

“28. Were the seized goods and samples deposited in the Malkhana at the
e a r l i e s t o p p o r t u n i t y a f t e r s e i z u r e , a n a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t
receipt obtained from the Malkhana−in−Charge? (emphasis added)

29. Were the samples sent to the designated laboratory for analysis and report
within 72 hours of seizure?” In Noor Aga vs. State of Punjab, (2008) 16 SCC 417,
under the NDPS Act, it was held :

Mohan Lal vs The State Of Punjab on 16 August, 2018

“91. The logical corollary of these discussions is that the guidelines such as
those present in the Standing Order cannot be blatantly flouted and substantial
compliance therewith must be insisted upon for so that sanctity of
physical evidence in such cases remains intact. Clearly, there has been no
substantial compliance with these guidelines by the investigating authority
which leads to drawing of an adverse inference against them to the effect
t h a t h a d s u c h e v i d e n c e b e e n p r o d u c e d , t h e s a m e w o u l d h a v e g o n e
against the prosecution.”

1 0 . U n l i k e t h e g e n e r a l p r i n c i p l e o f c r i m i n a l j u r i s p r u d e n c e
that an accused is presumed innocent unless proved guilty, the NDPS Act carries a reverse
burden of proof under Sections 35 and 54. But that cannot be understood to mean
that the moment an allegation is made and the F.I.R. recites compliance with statutory
procedures leading to recovery, the burden of proof from the very inception of the
prosecution shifts to the accused, without the prosecution having to establish or prove
anything more. The presumption is rebuttable. Section 35 (2) provides that a fact can
be said to have been proved if it is established beyond reasonable doubt and not on
p r e p o n d e r a n c e o f p r o b a b i l i t y . T h e s t r i n g e n t p r o v i s i o n s o f t h e N D P S A c t , s u c h
as Section 37, the minimum sentence of ten years, absence of any provision for remission, do
not dispense with the requirement of the prosecution to establish a prima facie
c a s e b e y o n d r e a s o n a b l e d o u b t a f t e r i n v e s t i g a t i o n , o n l y a f t e r
which the burden of proof shall shift to the accused. The case of the prosecution cannot be
allowed to rest on a preponderance of probabilities.

11. A fair trial to an accused, a constitutional guarantee under Article 21 of the
Constitution, would be a hollow promise if the investigation in a NDPS case were not to be
f a i r o r r a i s e s s e r i o u s q u e s t i o n s a b o u t i t s f a i r n e s s a p p a r e n t
on the face of the investigation. In the nature of the reverse burden of proof, the onus will lie
on the prosecution to demonstrate on the face of it that the investigation was fair, judicious with
no circumstances that may raise doubts about its veracity. The obligation of proof
b e y o n d r e a s o n a b l e d o u b t w i l l t a k e w i t h i n i t s a m b i t a f a i r
i n v e s t i g a t i o n , i n a b s e n c e o f w h i c h t h e r e c a n b e n o f a i r t r i a l .
If the investigation itself is unfair, to require the accused to demonstrate prejudice will be
fraught with danger vesting arbitrary powers in the police which may well lead to false
implication also. Investigation in such a case would then become an empty formality and
a farce. Such an interpretation therefore naturally has to be avoided.

12. That investigation in a criminal offence must be free from objectionable features or
infirmities which may legitimately lead to a grievance on part of the accused was noticed in
Babubhai vs. State of Gujarat, (2010) 12 SCC 254 as follows:

Mohan Lal vs The State Of Punjab on 16 August, 2018

“32. The investigation into a criminal offence must be free from
objectionable features or infirmities which may legitimately lead to a
g r i e v a n c e o n t h e p a r t o f t h e a c c u s e d t h a t
investigation was unfair and carried out with an ulterior motive. It is also the
d u t y o f t h e i n v e s t i g a t i n g o f f i c e r t o c o n d u c t t h e i n v e s t i g a t i o n
avoiding any kind of mischief and harassment to any of the accused. The
investigating officer should be fair and conscious so as to rule out
a n y p o s s i b i l i t y o f f a b r i c a t i o n o f e v i d e n c e a n d h i s
impartial conduct must dispel any suspicion as to its genuineness. The
investigating officer “is not merely to bolster up a prosecution case with
such evidence as may enable the court to record a conviction but to bring out
the real unvarnished truth”.

33. In State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma this Court has held as under:

“57. … Investigation is a delicate painstaking and dextrous process. Ethical
conduct is absolutely essential for investigative professionalism. … Therefore,
before countenancing such allegations of mala fides or bias it is salutary
and an onerous duty and responsibility of the court, not only to insist
u p o n m a k i n g s p e c i f i c a n d d e f i n i t e a l l e g a t i o n s o f p e r s o n a l

i n s i s t t o e s t a b l i s h a n d p r o v e t h e m f r o m t h e
facts and circumstances to the satisfaction of the court.

59. Malice in law could be inferred from doing of wrongful act intentionally
w i t h o u t a n y j u s t c a u s e o r e x c u s e o r w i t h o u t t h e r e
being reasonable relation to the purpose of the exercise of statutory power. …

1 3 . T h e d u t y o f t h e p r o s e c u t i o n u n d e r t h e N D P S A c t ,
considering the reverse burden of proof, was noticed in Noor Aga (supra) observing: − “58……An
i n i t i a l b u r d e n e x i s t s u p o n t h e p r o s e c u t i o n a n d o n l y w h e n i t s t a n d s
satisfied, would the legal burden shift. Even then, the standard of proof required for the accused to
prove his innocence is not as high as that of the prosecution. Whereas
the standard of proof required to prove the guilt of the accused on the prosecution is
“beyond all reasonable doubt” but it is “preponderance of probability” on the
accused. If the prosecution fails to prove the foundational facts so as to attract the
rigours of Section 35 of the Act, the actus reus which is possession of contraband by the accused

cannot be said to have been established.

Mohan Lal vs The State Of Punjab on 16 August, 2018

59. With a view to bring within its purview the requirements of Section 54 of the Act,
element of possession of the contraband was essential so as to shift the burden on the
accused. The provisions being exceptions to the general rule, the generality thereof
would continue to be operative, namely, the element of possession will have to be proved
beyond reasonable doubt.” Furthermore, the sample not having been deposited in the malkhana,
coupled with non−examination of the private witnesses, an adverse inference was drawn
t h e r e i n a g a i n s t t h e p r o s e c u t i o n . T h i s p r i n c i p l e h a s b e e n r e i t e r a t e d i n B h o l a

the complainant himself. The result of the investigation would therefore be a foregone conclusion.

requirements of a fair investigation under the NDPS Act only carrying a reverse burden

of the prosecution case. Megha Singh (supra) concerned a prosecution under the Terrorist and
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1985. It was held that the Head Constable being the

not be resorted to so that there may not be any occasion to suspect fair and impartial
investigation. Rajangam (supra) was a prosecution under the NDPS Act, an objection was taken
that PW−6 who apprehended the accused could not have investigated the case. Upholding the
objection, relying on Megha Singh (supra) the accused was acquitted. The view taken by the

17. Hardip Singh vs. State of Punjab, 2008 (8) SCC 557 concerned a prosecution under the

would be an interested person and should not have been made the investigating

the investigation would necessarily be unfair or biased.” Significantly, V.

Jayapaul, (supra) related to a prosecution under the Prevention of
Corruption Act which sought to distinguish Megha Singh, (supra) on its facts.

NDPS Act. There was no independent witness. The objection that PW−6, Sub−inspector Satbir
Singh being the complainant could not have investigated relying on Rajangam, (supra) and
Megha Singh, (supra) was rejected on the ground that he was not the sole person investigating
the case, and that the ground had not been raised before the High Court in appeal.

also notice the view taken by different High Courts on the issue. In State of Himachal Pradesh
vs. Atul Sharma 2015 (2) shimLC 693 (Crl. Appeal No. 246 of 2008, decided on 28.02.2015),
under the NDPS Act, it was observed as follows:

“10.8 In present case it is proved on record that complainant is SI Bahadur
Singh as per FIR Ext.PW12/A and it is proved on record that entire

complainant himself and there is no evidence on record in order to prove that
investigation was handed over to some other independent Investigating
Officer. It is not the case of prosecution that no other independent
Investigating Officer was available to conduct impartial investigation. We

21. A similar view has been taken in Shri Fayas Ali vs. State of Mizoram Crl. Appeal No. 26 of

the Gauhati High Court as follows:

“From the evidence of PWs 1 and 4, it is clearly found that the major part of the
i n v e s t i g a t i o n i n c l u d i n g t h e a r r e s t o f t h e a c c u s e d , p r e p a r a t i o n
of seizure, taking of sample, examination of the seizure witnesses and
examination of the accused person, was completed by the PW1, who was the
informant/complainant in the present case. Therefore, it is clearly found
that the investigation, in its true sense, was done by the complainant himself. In
the case of State by Inspector of Police, Narcotic Intelligence Bureau,
Madurai(supra), the Supreme Court, relying on the decision held in the
case of Megha Singh (supra), observed that the investigation is to be done by a
person other than the complainant and that the investigation done by the

complainant is bound to suffer and vitiate the entire proceeding.”

Sharma (supra), concluded as follows:

“14. Another aspect of the matter is that in sheer violation of the principles of
fair and impartial investigation, the complainant and the investigating officer
is the same person, which makes the prosecution case doubtful. In Laltu
Prasad v. State of West Bengal, 2017(2) R.C.R. (Criminal) 237 (Calcutta)
(DB), it was held that the complainant himself acting as the

investigation is a practice, to say the least, should not be resorted to and it is a
disturbing feature. To the same effect, is a Division Bench judgment of
Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh High Court reported as State of Himachal
Pradesh v. Atul Sharma and others, 2015 (6) R.C.R. (Criminal) 949,
wherein, it has been held that where the complainant himself conducts
investigation, it causes miscarriage of justice to accused qua fair investigation.”

of their valuable rights of contradicting and corroborating, the previous

PW1 is an Assistant Sub Inspector of Police, and I understand from the Public
Prosecutor as well as from the Counsel for the petitioner that the particular
Police Station has got a Sub Inspector of Police. Therefore, in this case,
the investigation ought to have been conducted by the Sub Inspector of Police
or any other Police Officer above the rank of PW1. In the instant case,
thus an incurable infirmity and flaw have been committed by the
prosecution, quite against the proposition of law. Therefore, on that score itself,

acquittal. In view of my above conclusion on the footing of position of law, this
is a fit case, which has to be allowed by acquitting the petitioner."

Disapproving of the same, a Division Bench in Kader vs. State of Kerala,
2001 CriLJ 4044, held:

“6. Unlike usual cases under the Criminal Procedure Code, in cases under

Therefore, we are of the opinion that merely because a detecting officer himself

v. State of Kerala 2000 (1) KLT 785 to the contrary is overruled.”

24. The view taken by the Kerala High Court in Kader (supra) does to
meet our approval. It tantamounts to holding that the F.I.R. was a
gospel truth, making investigation an empty formality if not a farce. The right of
the accused to a fair investigation and fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution will stand negated in that event, with arbitrary and
uncanalised powers vested?

with the police in matters relating to the NDPS Act and similar laws carrying a
reverse burden of proof. An investigation is a systemic collection of facts for the purpose

Kader (supra) is, therefore, overruled. We approve the view taken in Naushad (supra).

It is therefore held that a fair investigation, which is but the very foundation of fair trial,
necessarily postulates that the informant and the investigator must not be the same person.
Justice must not only be done, but must appear to be done also. Any possibility of bias or a
predetermined conclusion has to be excluded. This requirement is all the more
imperative in laws carrying a reverse burden of proof.

prosecution is held to be vitiated because of the infraction of the constitutional guarantee of a
fair investigation. The appellant is directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless
wanted in any other case.
